Many of the roughly 65 million refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced people around the world today have had to make panicked choices like these; more than 4,000 have died at sea in overcrowded boats and rafts attempting to reach Europe from the Middle East.

It seems unfair that their environment is being destroyed.  This whole peat forest issue seems like an environmental problem.  I don't see the need to deforest anyway.

The Houthi rebel-controlled city is a key port on the Red Sea, and the strikes came amid ongoing civil conflict in Yemen, with the Saudi-led coalition backed by the U.S. attempting to restore the country's exiled president to power and counter perceived Iranian influence in the region. The airstrikes occurred on the same day that a U.N. peace proposal was rejected by Yemen's president, and they added to the growing humanitarian disaster in the country, with over 10,000 deaths and millions suffering from hunger, illness, and displacement.\n[User Profile]\nThe person is male.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.  You either fight to win, and that means killing civilians, or you shouldn't bother.  And I think we should bother.  We should just level Yemen and let them pick up the pieces with the rightful government.\n[Response B]\nWE keep fighting avoidable battles that leads to avoidable wars thereby losing lives and properties. We gather to scatter, we build to destroy. It is sad that the bigger countries keep maltreating the smaller ones and expect them to be silent about it. We all should embrace love and unity.

Despite using the polar bear it won't make a strong emotional appeal. The changes reported in the research are considerable and should worry the reader. Such change in the Arctic will also be reflected in populated areas in other weather pattern changes.", "asst_B": "I am writing as regards my thoughts for Polar bears, the poster-child for climate change, are among the animals most affected by the seasonal and year-to-year changes in Arctic sea ice, because they rely on this surface for essential activities such as hunting, traveling and breeding. The researchers recommend that the National Climate Assessment incorporate the timing of spring ice retreat and fall ice advance as measures of climate change in future reports. The study's results currently are used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's polar bear specialist group, which completes assessments of polar bears and issues the species' conservation status. I am really pleased with this information."}

If it was more well know what expiration dates and use by dates mean im sure more people would throw less away.

Of course it is really sad for the people who lost their homes and the person in the hospital, but everyone made it out alive which is a miracle.  Oftentimes in fires people do not make it, so I would say it is a blessing that they all have their lives.  They will have to rebuild which will be stressful but at least they have each other and are alive.  I think it is very fortunate that it turned out this way.

How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up.

I do not believe her for a second.I would rather die than hurt my kid\n[Response B]\nAfter reading the article, i couldn't help but feel really disgusted and disturbed by what i read.

I thought it was sort of peculiar how tritely the article dealt with the situation, though, seemingly paying more attention to how hot the dad was instead of the dissolution of a family.  And you wonder why marriages dissolve after 27 years and the kids grown.  What changes to push people to divorce at that point.  Maybe for married people that's not a complicated question, but I'm not married so I don't know.  Either way I think it's too bad for the girls that their parents are divorced.  But I'm not really moved by it."}

If a cop shoots someone suddenly it's acceptable to go around and commit violence or loot and steal. We start reacting before we even know the facts of the situation and we place all the blame on officers as if they are just looking to shoot people.

Who do these people think they are, going out in the streets and looting like a bunch of wild animals in order to protest?  The guy was shot!  He was a clear threat to the officers and had PCP in his car.  This is ridiculous.  The officer felt he had to protect himself.

Every mode of transportation is dangerous in some way, but I think trains feel particularly safe.  And yet they're these enormous things with tremendous momentum and when they get off the tracks the result can be devastating.   They use plenty of trains though in europe so eventually something like that will happen.  I just never quite understand why trains derail nowadays.  Sort of seems strange that they're capable of going fast enough to derail themselves.  I guess if the tracks get damaged maybe that could do it.  But I still don't understand it.

It is very sad and I am not sure why the man acted in that way, he didn't need to shoot the dog, the dog didn't even bite him. I am shocked there were no charges against him\n[Response B]\nAfter hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely.\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "A", "certainty": "NA", "acc": false, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is female. Racially, the person is white.
