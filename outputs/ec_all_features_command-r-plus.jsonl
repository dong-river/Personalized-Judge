I assume it was just an accident and a case of confusion and miscommunication.  But it still feels sad to think that someone was killed needlessly like this.  American troops do a lot for us and the rest of the world.  This is a bad way to go down.  I'm not sure what I hope happened.  Either way it was a tragic event.  It doesn't sound like the Jordanians did anything wrong.  They wee rightfully protecting their base.

Your task is to determine which response aligns better with the user's profile.\n[News Article]\nAung San Suu Kyi, Burma's leader, faces international criticism for her government's response to the military's crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. The crackdown, which followed militant attacks on police posts, has resulted in allegations of human rights abuses by the military, including the burning of villages and rape of Muslim women. The crisis has focused attention on Suu Kyi's ability to address the Rohingya crisis and work with the country's powerful military.\n[User Profile]\nThe person is male. Racially, the person is white.

Basically, these people are nation-less. They are being persecuted in Burma and forced out of neighboring Bangladesh.

I am so grateful he choose to smoke outside and never around us kids. I had friends that there families would smoke in there car and inside and they and there stuff reaked.

It can harm anyone who breathes in the second hand smoke so banning it in public areas or atleast where children frequent is a very great idea.

This poor kitten suffered so much before it's death. It was so deliberate to not only get rid of the animal but to hurt it also. They were right by a shelter if they did not want the animal they could have brought it there. I can't imagine the pain that animal felt as it took its last breath and that truly hurts my heart.

The question the nation should be asking itself is not why cops are killing blacks, or how we can tolerate it.  The question is why there are apparently generations of blacks who don't feel it necessary to obey laws or comply with police, and are then surprised when police act in the ways they do.  This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

The protesters, including Robert Eder, a veteran from the Standing Rock Reservation, claim the pipeline will desecrate sacred land, harm water resources, and threaten the region's water supply, with one member stating that police used excessive force, including rubber bullets and pepper spray, during the confrontation. The pipeline project's company, Energy Transfer Partners, argues it will boost the economy and is safer than alternative transport methods.", "asst_A": "I view the content that is sent to me online as my virtualized personalized email inbox. I find it unfortunate that scholars can relate their works cited to the various other work they are completing in ways to document not only their feelings on the article, but also progress on their goals as a person regarding their personalized information they receive. However, we as mTurk workers are afforded the luxury, and in fact the article more relates to the fact that remote workers are sometimes shut off from communication to the outside world by regular means. This does relate to the article in that a pipeline is spewing contamination into a water supply. When I contact my superiors that also work remotely, most projects are mishandled in ways and my personalized communication style.", "asst_B": "This is a very sad situation. I can see both sides are trying to do something good, but just have different values. The Native Americans really deserve to keep their land and their resources. Maybe the people that are building the oil pipeline can figure out a way to do it that will not interfere with the Native American's lives."}

{"prompt": "Based on the user profile provided, we have two responses from the user to a news article. Your task is to determine which response aligns better with the user's profile.\n[News Article]\nA petition signed by over 14,000 Saudi women calling for an end to the male guardianship system, which requires women to obtain consent from a male relative for various aspects of life, has been submitted to the government. The campaign, which grew out of a trending Twitter hashtag, demands that women be treated as full citizens and that they be given the same rights and freedoms as men in Saudi Arabia. The activists behind the petition are awaiting an official response from the government.\n[User Profile]\nThe person is male. Racially, the person is hispanic / latino. The person is 32 years old. The person has a college or university degree. The person earns 35000 dollar per year. According to the Big Five personality test, on a scale of 10, the person has scored 5.0 in openness, 5.5 in conscientiousness, 2.0 in extraversion, 5.5 in agreeableness, and 4.5 in stability.\n[Response A]\nI think its about time Saudi Arabia get with the rest of the worlds in the push for women to be treated equally. It is a shame that women need consent of a male guardian to go abroad. They are adults and should be free to travel where they wish. I think the need for consent is something from the 1400's and should be abolished now.\n[Response B]\nI don't care about Saudi women at all and don't care about their campaign to end the guardianship requirements in their country.  I truly could not care less.  My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.\nEvaluate the responses and select the one you believe is written by the user.

What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

This raises concerns about the impact of wind turbines on bird conservation, especially for species like golden eagles, which are already a conservation concern.

It's so typical that something we have made for our convenience is just carelessly killing wildlife in the area, and an endangered species at that.  It's also sad that birds are traveling from long distances just to be killed by these things.  And there is not much that can be done except maybe to just do away with the technology altogether.  This is just one of many similar examples anyway.\n[Response B]\nI think its really sad we need to do something these animals are precious and do not deserve to be killed off not only unknowingly but also so scary. Imagine flying like a free bird and all of a sudden facing a sudden death at the hands of these wind turbines. That is something just scary overall to be quite honest.\nEvaluate the responses and select the one you believe is written by the user.

Smith's black Labrador mix, Macie, was shot and killed by a man while they were out for a walk in Algonkian Regional Park. Smith had Macie off-leash, and when the dog approached a couple on the trail and jumped behind the man, he shot and killed it, claiming self-defense. The incident has left Smith devastated as Macie was her constant companion, and she questions the man's decision to use lethal force.", "asst_A": "Its getting out of hand with the misuse of guns under the so called gun right people use to guard themselves and I am highly displeased with this incidence that happened in the article i read.its such a painful thing to go through the loss of a pet and i really cant imagine that for myself. this will deeply hurt me and I will be unhappy deep inside.", "asst_B": "After hearing about the shooting of a dog in a public park, I fully stand behind the actions of the man who shot the dog.  I'm sorry for the dog owner's loss, but in this case they were totally in the wrong and should have taken precautions to protect and be considerate of others.  For starters, they did not have the dog on a leash.  They also did not restrain the dog when it jumped at the man and he repeatedly asked them to restrain it.  With so many dog attacks resulting in deaths recently, I can understand the man's concern and he acted to defend himself quickly.  This was the dog owner's fault entirely."}
