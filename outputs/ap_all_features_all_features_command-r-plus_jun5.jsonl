I went to the barber last weekend to get a quick shape-up and I ended up getting more than I bargained for. Long story short, my hair now looks like it's been styled with a blender! I suppose it's just nature's way of reminding me that I could be bald, so I should be thankful for any hair, at all while I can. Anyway, have you had any bad hair experiences recently? Maybe a bad cut or color disaster? \nAnswer: oh man, i can relate an unfortunate hair experience. i've had mine cut into what can only be described as 'helmet hair' once. it took a good month to grow back into a more, shall we say, 'human' look. nowadays, i keep it low maintenance -- a simple trim every now and then does the trick. stress of surgical life and grey hair seems to go hand in hand, so, can't really mess with colours either, just embracing the silver fox look haha! lesson learned anyway: sometimes simpler is better.\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Sleep was a rare commodity during those times. Even though I knew it's the cumulative essence of what we learn over time that holds importance, those milestone exams always brought about an adrenaline rush. How did you feel during your last educational exams? Were they of critical importance in shaping your career or course of education?\nAnswer: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.\n\nThe only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. \n\nAnd although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "95", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

It made me ponder a bit about it, as I've been in a relationship for a long time but never took the leap to get married. How about you, have you ever thought about it? What are your views on commitment like marriage?\nAnswer: You know, I've often found myself reflecting on that too. The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! \ud83d\ude02 But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship.

I remember those days when I would go to the cinema on my own, watch double-headers, and even participate in movie marathons. Since getting hitched though, I only get to see the movies that my spouse also enjoys. Are you a movie buff as well? Do you prefer going to the movies alone, or do you bring someone along? How does that work out for you? \nAnswer: Oi, mate! Remember the good ol' days when ye could head to the cinema on a whim? Me too! These days, it's more of a diplomatic process, lol. Occasionally I end up at a sappy rom-com when I've been angling for an action flick. Ah well, the things we do for a peaceful weekend, am I right? \n\nBut, hey, let's not underestimate the power of Netflix and a lazy Saturday afternoon. Gives a bloke the chance to sneak in a flick or two that the missus might not necessarily vibe with. Plus, catching a movie at home means you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for popcorn. Those prices, yeesh, it's a tough gig on a pensioner's paycheck! The only thing not so great is the online discussions afterward... not quite the same as a post-movie debate/argument at the local pub with your mates. Ah, I do miss those too. \n\nSo, to your question... company or solo? Well, it's kind of a mixed bag now, and you just learn to make the most of it as time marches on :)\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

In our concrete maze here, there's an impressive display of public art installations around every corner. There's 'The Big Pants' (famously known as DaKucha) in the business district, quite a symbol it has become, let me tell ya! But for me, the real artistic soul of the place is in the hutongs. Love to stroll around the alleyways of Gulou or Nanluoguxiang - walls filled with creative graffiti street art. It's like a real-life Reddit thread, unpredictable and amusing!

One of my favorites dishes to prepare now is 'pasta alla carbonara'. But, I must admit, no matter how hard I try, it never tastes quite the same as it did in Rome. I guess it must have something to do with the local ingredients they use. What's a local dish from your area that you think I should try cooking?\nAnswer: Oh la la, sounds like you've had a taste of the real deal in Rome! Here in Toronto (and by extension all of Canada), we're quite famous for Poutine. It's a dish with french fries topped with cheese curds and smothered in gravy. Sounds a bit strange eh, but trust me, you haven't lived till you've tried a solid poutine! You should absolutely give it a whirl, and it's relatively easy to make at home. Bonus points if you can get your hands on real cheese curds.\n \nBut personally, as a psycholgist I do find myself constantly analyzing why people are such fans of it- could it be the comfort-food-like warmth or the goofy blend of ingredients? Either way, it certainly keeps this gal happy as a beaver in the winter! Lol. Now my fellow Canadians, don't get all flapped at me, I know there are regional squabbles about the \"correct' way to make it, but we can at least all agree it's a Canadian staple, right? :)\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "95", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

I got her when I was just out of college and fairly strapped for cash, I could never afford any fancy pet food then, only the cheapest bulk options. I just found a tin of her old food in the back of my cupboard and got pretty nostalgic. What about you, do you have a pet? What kind of food or treats do you usually get for them?\nAnswer: Ah, your story made me a bit nostalgic. Used to have a Weimaraner names Lessing. Feedin' him was bit of trouble since he's rather fussy. I usually bought this grain-free dog food from a local place. It was affordable and actually good for him. Also hauled bulk basics from Aldi every now and then... Gotta fit the ole middle-income bracket ya know. \ud83d\ude09 But then he really loved provolone cheese. Gave him bits as an occasional treat. Now even the smell of provolone takes me back, you know? Good times, good times. Haven't had the heart to get another pet since he passed. It's been too quiet here in Berlin.

One day, during my sophomore year, my group and I were working on a Physics assignment that had us stumped. We spent hours working on it, and finally decided to break the rules a little. We snuck into a senior physics class, hoping to get some hints. In the end, it turned out that the assignment was meant to be unsolvable. The professor confessed that he was testing our problem-solving skills! Now, did you ever have a similar experience or a moment in studies that you found particularly challenging or amusing? Can you share? \n\n\nAnswer: oh mate, i've got a good one for this... back when i was studying, we had this one ancient roman history course that was notorious among students. our professor was old school, firm believer of \"to learn history, you got to feel history\".\n\nthere was this one instance, when we were studying about roman military tactics, the professor decided that just reading about it wouldn't cut it. next thing we know, we are in the university's soccer field, divided into legions, enacting the battle of zama, with watering cans as stand-ins for war elephants! looking back, that day was mad exhausting, but definitely one of the most memorable and hard-hitting classes. guess nothing drives the point home like soaking your mates with watering cans pretending to be 'war elephants'! :D\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "85", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

It sounds beautiful but I'm not sure I could ever swap my huge city life for a small coastal one. You know the hustle and bustle, iconic buildings, 24/7 business, and multicultural environment, I find thrill in it. But I was wondering, how would you describe the surroundings where you live? Is it more like a busy city or a calm town? Any iconic or distinct features?\nAnswer: Ah, that's an easy one mate! Picture yourself walking down cobblestone streets filled with mouthwatering aromas of fresh pasta, pizza, and roasted coffee wafting from every corner. You can feel the pulse of the city under your feet, buzzing with energy, rhythm, and life. A glance upward and you see weathered terracotta roofs juxtaposed against a backdrop of a modern cityscape. And, oh, the sounds! A cacophony of accents in the air, a testament of the rich cultural melting pot that I reside in. At the heart of it? Well, you've probably guessed it, an ancient amphitheatre standing strong & proud, whispering tales of gladiators and emperors. Bustling with so much action, it might as well stay awake all day, all night. But it isn't all city, there's a balance. Nature is close, just a short jaunt, and you suddenly find yourself surrounded by rolling vineyards which will make you forget about the city grip. So, city-but-not-too-much is the life for me.

After quite a bit of research and thinking, I finally decided to start investing in stocks. It's been an interesting journey so far, learning about different sectors, analyzing balance sheets, and the likes. But the pandemic and the global financial situation has surely made things more unpredictable. Have you tried any form of investing before? How has it been going for you?\nAnswer: Oh absolutely! I did play around with some basic, safe stocks a few years back, mostly from publishing houses or cultural institutes. I mean who else would a devotee of Goethe n\u2019 Schiller invest in, right? \ud83d\ude05 But then again, with my income bracket, as a humble educator who inspires young minds to appreciate the beauty of German literature, I'm hardly raking in enough dough to gamble in the dog eat dog world of stock market, let alone during these unpredictably turbulent times of pandemic and what not. I'd rather save my penny here n there for able to grab an old edition of Faust or The Sorrows of Young Werther from a dusty corner of a second-hand bookstore, or to keep myself updated and connected on these platforms,right here online.... my kind of long term investment \ud83d\ude0c What can I say...Old habits die hard!

You'd not believe how often wedding rings give away my disguise. It's such a common thing to check! I've even stopped wearing one just to stay convincing. Do you believe in this tradition of wearing a wedding ring or does it feel somewhat outdated to you?\nAnswer: Mate, take it from a man who spends most of his time surrounded by thousands of years of tradition at work, the ring's more than just a circular piece of metal. Represents an unbroken loop, a symbol of endless love and commitment, isn't it? But hey, I get your point. In my line of work, handle artifacts with great care, too risky with a ring on. So it sits safe at home rather than on my finger. Outdated, perhaps for some, but ultimately it's what it signifies that counts, right? Doesn't make me less married or anything. \ud83d\ude09\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

It made me think about the pros and cons of having a big wedding versus a small, intimate one. What's your perspective on this? Do you think big weddings are worth it, or do you prefer the idea of a smaller, more intimate event? \nAnswer: yeah weddings, always a topic... i remember having a chat with my SO about this a while back. we're pretty much on the same page ya know. a massive, fairy-tale wedding doesn't really scream 'us'. \n\ndon't get me wrong, I can see the appeal of a grandiose occasion \u2013 the spectacle, the pure joy, seeing all your loved ones in one place... but for me, I prefer the thought of something more low-key, more intimate. it feels so much more personal, you know?\n\nalso, as an architect, i have a penchant for minimalistic designs, carry that over to weddings too i reckon. a small, cozy event in a place that holds sentimental value, like maybe a cabin up in the Swedish mountains or a beautiful historic building in Stockholm where I grew up. really embracing the beauty of simplistic design. this might sound cheesy but it's like a parallel to building a home: it's not about the frills, it's about the foundation - in this case, the bond two people share. \n\nbesides, with my mid-tier income here in gothenburg, kinda favor the less financially-straining version, just being honest :D anyway, who knows? plans may change when it's actually 'the time'. we're in no rush though, just enjoying life as it is for now :D\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "85", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Last year, I managed to visit Madrid and I was totally blown away by the Spanish cuisine. Of course, those trips can be quite costly, especially when one is considering international flights that could burn a whole in your pocket. I had to save up for several months before I could afford the flights and accommodations. Anyways, do you have any traveling experience? What was the most expensive trip you've ever been on, and what memories does it brings back?\n\n\nAnswer: Oh, I absolutely love to travel! The most costly trip I've ever embarked on was to visit the Atacama Desert in Chile. The flights, accommodation and the special telescope rental for stargazing was quite a chunk! But the skies there... they're beyond magnificent, breathtaking even. Well worth every pound. Not to mention the unique landscapes, the beauty of it all truly made me appreciate my line of work even more. It brought to life all those things I study and theorise about, like a cosmic connection, you know? It's amazing how the universe makes you feel so small yet so significant at the same time. Right in the feels every time I think about it. Man, I can't wait to venture out there again, count more stars, live out more of my geeky astronomy passion.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "95", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

I'm naturally a saver rather than a spender, but I can't resist splurging on books and tech gadgets every once in a while. What about you? Do you have any specific hobbies or interests that you love to spend money on?\nAnswer: Oh man, nostalgia trip. Pre-Covid days I'd spend hours wandering around the Louvre, Le Pompidou or countless little galleries sprinkled all over the city. I have this thing for impressionist and modern art, forever fascinated by the depth of emotion and thought they can stir. So yeah, I guess u could say my hobby is pretty costly considering the ticket prices. \n\nBut hey, I'm an art curator in Paris, earning reasonably well, so why not spend on what i really love right? :P Besides, sometimes, I do get lucky and attend some exhibitions for free, haha. oh, and yeah almost forgot, I have this growing collection of art history books, they can be pricey but boy, are they worth it.

As a man, you know, when you buy basketball shoes, it is not only for playing the game but you can also wear them casually. I am a huge Jordan fan and I got myself a pair of Air Jordan 11 Retros. They are super comfortable and lightweight. What kind of shoes are your go-to, for either sports or casual wear, and why so?\nAnswer: ah, the ubiquitous sneaker talk, right? for me, it's been all about the well worn-in Birkenstock slides - comfort rules everything around me these days. though gotta admit, i miss the triumph of finding the perfect fitting pair of heels for that special occasion, but they were never really in the running for daily wear lol. i've turned into such a comfort seeker in my \"mature age\" ;) congrats on your Jordan 11s by the way, a classic choice!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Can you remember any particular song or type of music that takes you back to your childhood?\nAnswer: Aha, music! So you're a jazz fan, huh? Interesting! well, here for us in Portugal, it's all about the Fado music. A deep soulful kind of music genre that's like... engrained in our culture.

It\u2019s an evocative kind of music ya know, you listen to it, and it's like a smoky, nostalgic trip down memory lane of a good ol' time in a city by the river. Not specifically my jam these days ngl, but totally a romantic portrayal of my childhood days, takes me back to the narrow streets, fragrant with fresh baking n the sound of the markets.

What's your favorite bit about it?\nAnswer: oh mate, you\u2019ve hit the nail there. being part of a tropical nation, our holiday markets aren't all about mulled wine or roasting chestnuts like i'm guessing its in Germany, but they're an experience nevertheless! Tons of local food stalls pop up selling dishes from every corner of our country. You haven\u2019t experienced real holiday market fun till you\u2019ve tried \u2019munkoyo\u2019 - our own traditional non-alcoholic beverage. Gives you a bit of a vino vibe but also has a unique fermented edge. And who can forget tasty \u2018Nshima\u2019! Also, we've a thing called 'unity dance', it's like our Christmas jig, haha. Favourite bit? A tie between the foods and dancing. Its that moment where the hustle of the city seems to pause, and all that\u2019s left is good cheer and belly-ache laughs.

The beauty of the biodiversity was just astounding. The trees, plants, and little critters living there were all part of this intricate system where every single organism had its own role to play.

Between the sleepless exam weeks, unpredictable social life, and the never-ending assignments, it was definitely a roller coaster. But I have to say, it was during those times that I truly discovered my love for economics and everything related. I'd spend hours, sometimes days, breaking down economic theories, analyzing case studies, and applying them to real-world scenarios. It was stressful but incredibly rewarding. What about you, do you have a specific academic or professional topic that you're really passionate about?\nAnswer: Oh mate, reading your comment brought back memories of me studying in the wee hours, churning through piles of case studies, and deriving business strategies. Can't say I miss the stress, but those times did ignite a deep passion for business strategy in me. Down to today, as a retired CEO with a Bachelors in Business Administration under my belt, I'll find myself drawn into business news or problems faced by companies, and before I know it, I'm sketching up solutions on a napkin. Just can't help myself, that's most of my reddit activity right there, hahaha... getting nitty-gritty with business & strategizing, oh it's a riot! What can I say, it's in my blood!

Just last week, I was driving past a school in the morning, and there was this really happy kid running towards his class, waving at every person he passed by. It had an immediate effect on me. I was originally on the way to a client meeting and was feeling nervous, but that boy's enthusiasm really changed my perspective and made me feel inspired. I was motivated and, needless to say, that meeting went really well! Little things, huge impacts, right? Do you recall any little encounter or incident that had a profound impact on you recently?\nAnswer: oh totally! there's this little interaction that comes to mind. the other day i was debating over a minor character arc in this interactive story I'm working on - wasn't sure if I should keep him as a silent but driven guy, or make him more talkative and vulnerable. late one night, i bumped into this guy after work. didn't know him but boy, was he a character. Came across like the silent, brooding type at first glance but once he got talking, he displayed such vulnerability it was endearing. I ended up using him as a blueprint for my character and gotta say, it's working out pretty well so far. Amazing how these small turns of events can rev up your motivation.

Personally, my academic journey had more twists and turns than I ever expected. After studying linguistics for my bachelor\u2019s, I decided to completely switch and pursue a master\u2019s in data science recently. It\u2019s been challenging but definitely fascinating. Seems like diving into complex data sets and spotting unseen patterns is my new passion. How have you experienced your path? Has your passion driven your choices, or were you pulled towards a completely new direction unexpectedly, and why? Also, if you care to share, what subjects or fields have intrigued you the most?\nAnswer: oh boy, quite a journey for you! my path's been kinda similar tho. had a thing for the stars since early on, like when a wee kid stared at that Glasgow sky you know. Thought would go straight into that, but life's a funny ol' thing, wanted the big city life n' ended up in Edinburgh. Work wise, i've not really been pulled in a new direction per se. still gazing at stars but on a whole different level. Being an astronomer is...interesting, to put it lightly. instead of seeing them twinklin', now im mostly crunching numbers, spinning theories, deciphering the secrets of the cosmic ballet. no regrets tho. as for subjects that fascinate me the most, I'm partial to nebulas and black holes. strange, beautiful, mysterious, they are like the epitome of why I love this field. fascinating how we once thought they were just empty dark spots, but they turned out to hold so much more inside, kinda like us humans yeah?\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

At first, it was an expensive habit due to the amount of quality ingredients needed but now, it's become a tradition. Even when I've had to tighten my purse strings, I never skimp on this one tradition. Maybe you have something similar? Is there a holiday tradition or hobby that you've put some quality money into?\nAnswer: Just like you with your Christmas cake, every holiday season, there's this one bottle of wine I always snag, never comes cheap but gotta treat yoself, right? It's not just the taste, somehow it's become a yearly tradition that brings that special festive feeling. Trust me, with the chaos of my work (psychology practice ain't easy, folks), it's one small luxury I look forward to - a quiet night in my fairly-packed Toronto apartment, good wine, and maybe a movie or scrolling some fiery Reddit threads. In a way, it's my self-care act, brings some more meaning to the holiday season.

It ran perfectly and took me everywhere I needed to go. No flashy sports car, but it was all I could afford. What was your first car like? What drove (pun intended) you towards that choice?\nAnswer: Ah, man, my first set of wheels, what a memory to dig up! I was knee-deep in writing code for my first big game project, and convenience was the name of the game. Got myself a little Subaru Impreza hatchback, second-hand, not the newest model, but reliable and practical enough to haul my coffee and late-night ramen supplies from Akihabara lol. No-fuss parking in the city was a godsend too, Tokyo spots can be a real pain, you know?\nThat chunky little beast ain't gonna win me any points in a Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift sequel, but it does the job, and then some.

And do you have any tricks to squeeze in things you enjoy doing?\n\n\nAnswer: oh absolutely! my days can get pretty bonkers, going from one meeting to another, wracking my brain on how to make spaces work together. but ya know, gotta pay bills and all. but i know what you mean by squeezing in the things you enjoy! sometimes, i give myself these little \"breaks\" from the hectic day \u2013 i scroll through reddit, get lost in subreddits I follow, it's my little form of escape. there's one really cool about illusions and optical trickery that i'm absolutely hooked on, kinda gives me different perspectives on the things i work with, you could say! but yeah, hope that answers your ques! :)\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I loved hiking and exploring, especially trying to spot the state bird, the Lark Bunting, or other elusive creatures. I'm curious, what kind of wildlife do you encounter in your neck of the woods? You ever stumble across any particularly interesting critters while out for a walk or hike?\nAnswer: Oh, no mountain ranges for me, mate! My treks generally involve a sea breeze brushing past me and tons of birds (cockatoos can get noisy, I tell you!). Once I did stumble upon a band of eerie fruit bats in a park during an evening stroll. Not exactly Rocky Mountains material, but an adventure in its own right!

Last time I visited the Pike Place Market in Seattle, it was such a vibrant experience. The aroma of fresh seafood, flowers, and brewed coffee was awesome! Do you ever visit farmers markets in your town? What's your favorite thing to buy?\n\nAnswer: Oh la la, farmers markets are the essence of life! I currently live in Paris and we have these quaint little markets pretty much everywhere. Last Sunday, I visited the one at Rue Poncelet, and man, can't tell you how lively it was - almost like a festival! Those glossy red tomatoes, ripened camemberts and the assortment of olives...C'est la vie! My heart always nudges towards the art postcards - I am an art curator after all, cher ami! It\u2019s a habit I have, buying those postcards - a simple souvenir which is essentially a small piece of art for me, mon dieu! p.s \u2013 if you felt a waft of nostalgia smelling that brewed coffee, wait till you smell the freshly baked croissants here, heaven!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I have a huge stack of X-Men and Avengers comics that I've been keeping since my early teens. It's such a joy to go back and reread them from time to time. Are you into comics as well? If so, which ones do you enjoy the most?

Hobbies.. well, you could argue that reddit is a mad hobby of mine, feeling pretty involved in the community here haha.

The bill almost gave me a heart attack! Seriously I need to reconsider if I should continue maintaining it or just switch to public transport. Vehicle maintenance really shakes up the budget sometimes doesn't it? What is your experience with this? Do you own a vehicle and how do you go about its maintenance?\nAnswer: oh dear! ain't that the truth? ever since i moved to beijing from shanghai i've relied heavily on the metro system. let's be real here, with my work as an architect demanding so much time (not to mention sanity, lol), juggling a car's routine maintenance feels like one hell of a chore. plus, i'll let you in on a little secret - not having to bother with the chinese driving test horrors is a massive bonus! \n\nDon't get me wrong though, it's not always sunshine and daisies with the public transportation system either. it has its fair share of rush hour traffic and occasional hiccups - forcing me to leave my cozy, little apartment earlier to beat the crowds. but hey, if that means i can spend my income on my architecture masterpieces and ridiculous amounts of craft materials instead of throwing it away in a gasoline pit, i'll take it!\n\nbottom line?

I've heard about it quite a few times! I'm more of a lurker on reddit. During my high school days though, my obsession was a bit more tangible.

He's only 8 but can navigate online and use technology brilliantly. It's a far cry from when I was his age - we had just a family computer! I imagine this impacts all sorts of work environments. I'm curious if you've experienced any big tech changes in your working life, and if so, how have they affected you? Can you share any particular instances where you had to learn or adapt to a new technology or system rapidly? \nAnswer: oh, absolutely! love this topic. As a university professor, the last year has totally thrown me into the tech-world, deeper than I ever anticipated. COVID forced us to switch entirely to online teaching, which, let's be honest, can be a total tech-nightmare \ud83d\ude05. Imagine lecturing to a bunch of black screens with muted mics - feels like talking to a wall sometimes. \n\nI'm pretty active on sites like Reddit, but trust me, handling zoom, online quizzes and grading systems, classroom platforms like Blackboard, it was like learning a whole new tech-language! Had a couple of... let's call them 'embarrassing mishaps' early on, like that time when i accidentally ended the zoom call while trying to share my screen during a lecture. the students got a good laugh out of that, lol.\n\nAnd don't get me started on setting up home-office. Suddenly, I had to figure out ideal lighting for my video calls, positioning of my laptop, even the color of my wall became apparently incredibly important!\n\nBut you know what, despite the bumpy ride, I do appreciate the quick adaptability it's forced on me. it's also wonderful to be able to share and access academic resources more freely online. Plus, I think students are getting a kick out of screenshotting my confused face when a new tech glitch comes up...

As much as I love my old Honda, it's served me pretty well, I think it's time for an upgrade, but money wise I'm comparing pros and cons between the Toyota Camry and a Subaru, given my dog and love for camping trips.

I'm partial to my trusty VW Gol, a regular workhorse that one.

Nothing like chucking the laptops aside, embracing the Colombian wilderness, just me, wifey, and the campfire. Beats frolicking with gradients and vectors any day!

It's about Ataturk, our founding father, and how he won the Battle of Sakarya against the Greeks, right near my hometown. Talk about being the underdog and coming on top eh.

She's super excited because it allows her to live in the city. She could easily afford to rent a nice apartment in a gentrified area because of the new income. Looking back, after I graduated\u2014feel like it was centuries ago\u2014I had to share a small studio with a friend in a more affordable part of town for quite some years. So what was your living situation like after you graduated? Any housing or relocation struggles or were you quite set directly? Or, perhaps, are you still a student? How are you managing things right now?\nAnswer: Ah, those university days! Seems like it was just yesterday when I wrapped up my masters program and was thrown into the 'real world'. Had to do a bit of adjustments, mind you. Initially, moved into this charming old-fashioned apartment near the Louvre - more Bohemian Quarter than posh Champs Elysees, but it had a certain artistic flair that resonated with my taste. Shared it with a couple of art enthusiasts like myself who introduced me to absinthe and the delight of late-night philosophical chats. \n\nNowadays, I'm comfy in my own space closer to where I work. Doing alright financially, enough to occasionally indulge in some interesting art pieces from up-and-coming talents or join some friends for bouillabaisse in one of the Michelin-starred restaurants around town. Still remember those early struggles though, gives you some perspective, you know? Makes you appreciate the journey, as long or winding as it may be. But, hey, wouldn't trade those experiences for the world! So, to the students out there, hang in there, it'll all be worth it!

It's crazy up here, the rush, the hustle and all the skyscrapers. What a view at night! But, sometimes I really miss my home town's open fields and that beautiful smell of lavender. You see, I come from this small town in France with acres of lavender fields. The picturesque sight and the calming smell is truly unique, makes you want to lose yourself in the magnificence of nature, you know? Do you have some unique natural feature in your hometown or city that makes it stand out?\nAnswer: Jassis, here in Cape Town, we're absolutely spoiled by Mother Nature, I tell you! I mean, we've got Table Mountain right here, practically on our doorstep, and it's seriously one of the most beautiful sights you'll ever see. Almost everywhere you look in the city, there it is...as if watching over us all the time. And the smell of fynbos on a hike up there, it's intoxicating, something truly unique to this part of South Africa. And don't even get me started on our beaches, hey. They're just as wonderful, but in a different, more sort of a refreshing way. So, yeah, I reckon if you've got a thing for nature, you best come visit Cape Town my friend, it's a kaleidoscope of natural beauty.

Their music is so powerful and feels so timeless. It's crazy to think that some of their iconic songs were released more than 50 years ago. I also remember how devastated I was when John Lennon got assassinated in 1980. Do you remember any huge celebrity moments from when you were younger, like a shocking event or something?\nAnswer: Oh geez, do I ever. I remember hearing about Princess Diana\u2019s tragic car crash in '97. I was in my early twenties, just getting a handle on running my own shop, and I remember standing there behind my counter, dumbstruck, listening to the radio report. I didn't know her, ofc, but she seemed so relatable and I admired her a lot - it felt a bit like losing a distant friend, if you get my drift. It's probably not as cool as being a Beatles fan in their prime, but boy, did it hit me hard.\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

What was the climate like there?\nAnswer: ah, the youthful trips, I remember them well! ours was never up in the mountains, but instead headed the other direction. We'd pile in the car and escape the skyscrapers for the calming waves and sandy shores of the coastal town of Santos.

I was running around on the beach, playing football with the local kids not caring about anything else... best time of my life, hands down. Hot days, the summer weather, even the occasional tropical storm. but i would trade those, one stormy day near the ocean, than a whole year not seeing the shoreline! what wouldn't i give to experience that again... but now, life's mostly about saut\u00e9 pans and burner flames.

Nothing quite like the feeling of gliding over the cool water at the crack of dawn with your crew, feeling like you're part of something bigger. We used to travel all across the country for championships and regattas, from the busy Charles River in Boston to the serene Potomac in Washington D.C. Do you have any rowing clubs nearby where you live? Or any other spots where people usually go to for recreational activities? \n\nAnswer: Rowing, huh? I can completely get the allure, especially at dawn when the world's just stirring awake. I haven't rowed myself, though I've dreamed about giving it a shot. In my corner of the world, kayaking's a bit more of the go to. There's this specific spot, right out to the Atlantic, that the locals swear by. Get quite territorial about it too, heh, it's kinda adorable. I prefer my morning jog by the riverside here in Bairro Alto - what can I say? Some solid ground under my feet is more my speed, and the view of the April 25th Bridge is totally worth it.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

It was a fantastic opportunity although putting aside about 30% of my income for the stint was crucial for me to be able to sustain the lifestyle there. How about you? Have you ever had an experience where you needed to put aside a significant amount of your income for an opportunity or a personal goal?\nAnswer: I reckon the closest I've come to that is saving up for a backpacking trip around Europe. I was still studying and working part-time as a tutor. Juggling between uni assignments, tutoring and making time for some cheeky reddit scrolling. Can't say it wasn't a challenge to channel most of my tutoring earnings into a travel fund instead of fun stuff online, (cries in steam sales and cute merch).

Always a new software popping up every year that promises to revolutionize the industry on thursday, or some innovative 'green' concept that translates into me scrambling around, trying to figure out how a rooftop garden would feed into a complex rainwater collection and irrigation system. Looks amazing in renderings but the reality? Not always so pretty. So, yeah, one might say my work ain't exactly a slow-paced affair.

I used to enjoy the brainstorming sessions and group work for project assignments. The failing and trying again, it was all fun, educational and so much within your control. I wonder whether working adults enjoy the same. Like, what are your thoughts on working in a team, especially if it's a challenging project that involves lots of problem-solving? Got any interesting or frustrating experiences to share? \nAnswer: oh boy, do i have stories! working as a chef, team work is basically the bread and butter, kinda like how the pasta is to the bolognese sauce, you know? when it's rush hour and you've got to feed a restaurant fulla famished customers, you gotta rely on your sous chefs, line cooks and everyone in between like your life depends on it. we got interesting dynamics, especially in an italian kitchen. i remember when our supplier messed up the delivery of the buffalo mozzarella for the caprese salad on the busiest night, it was a bunch of chaos, dealing with that was... quite something! :D on one hand, you got everyday challenge of bridging the communication gap let's say amongst front of house and the kitchen, so many egos and personalities. So yeah, glaring at them for sending back a dish or letting them know the wait time isn\u2019t too long, there is quite a tangle. but then again, seeing customers smile after a well-made dish? 100% worth it. don't regret a single moment of stress in this profession, despite the frustration :]\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: Yeah, I am pretty torn about this modern trend of people naming their pets with human names. Like, my neighbour got a little cute puppy and named it \"Oliver.\" I was like, \"Seriously, isn't Oliver like a toddler's name or something?\" Then, on the other hand, my childhood best friend went down the old route and named his cat \"Whiskers.\" Seems like the pet-naming business is pretty intense. What are your thoughts on this? Do you have any pets, and if so, what are their names?\n\n\nAnswer: haha, well mate, i'm a bit in a pickle with this. u see, because i'm a part-time waiter and full-time student living in a wee london flat, haven't really got the room or time for a pet. bit of a downer, i know.\n\nstill, back home in budapest, hungary, i had this old, scruffy cat named Miska. quite a traditional hungarian cat name, that. i reckon there's something quite comforting with sticking to the classics ya know, comforts of home and all that. \n\nthat said, i've seen some people on reddit threads who've given their pets well funny human names, and I had a right laugh over it. if i ever do get a pet in the big smoke, might just go with Boris - could make for some great banter at the pub. 'just taking Boris for a walk, lads. alright, boris, don't piddle on the carpet!' gets me every time, it does.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

It really made me think about how information used to spread during the good old days compared to now in the era of online journalism, social media, etc. I guess the smooth transition from print to digital media is commendable, but it also comes with its own set of challenges, right? What's your take on this? How do you perceive the evolution of media and its impact on society? Do you think the prominence of digital journalism over print is a positive trend for society?\nAnswer: oh absolutely, the transition has been nothing short of a revolution really, being able to access virtually any piece of information from anywhere is mighty. on the other hand, having to wade through endless clickbait headlines to find anything of value can really feel like you are slogging through thick fog :/ \n\ni suppose it's a bit of a double-edged sword, in a way. there's a rush to publish \"hot takes\" on current events which sometimes results in a sacrifice of thoroughness, or even correctness. that said, we've also seen an expansion of voices in the media landscape, which can only be good for promoting diverse perspectives. \n\nbut, don\u2019t get me wrong, as someone who is on the internet a lot and has fully embraced social media, I see the benefits - it's just that there's also a fair bit of nostalgia for the times when evenings would involve flipping through a good book or a thoughtful article from a reputable newspaper, rather than scrolling through an endless barrage of opinions, some less informed than others.\n\nso yeah, i guess i gotta say it's a bit of a mixed bag for me. anyway, i'd love to hear from you or anyone else who's been adapting to this brave new world too!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Do you have any local games that involve unique linguistic or cultural elements?\nAnswer: oh, Marrakech, heard about it just haven't gotten around to it yet, lol. now abt local games, u might laugh but around the time the stars burned bright n the summer temps were liken to an oven (pile on that Texas heat, yo!) we'd have massive neighborhood-wide games of Hide 'n Seek. Yes, yes i know what you're thinking, but it's not just regular ol' H&S.\n\nu see, we gave it our own spin: we had our own jargon, \"hider\" was a \"gecko\", \"finder\", we'd call 'em \"rattles\", short for rattlesnake (u find quite a bunch around here, not a friendly encounter lemme tell ya that much). The \"base\" where the finder starts from, we dubbed it \"The Alamo\" (well, guess that one was kinda obvious). And to make it intresting every round wld have a diff theme, like movies, books, etc and ur hiding spot had to reflect it ...crafty adult versions, that's how i'd represent it.\n\nAnd yes, obviously education kicked in at some point suggesting that grown-ups should act all formal but i say nay! life's too short, y'know? I still organize an annual \"Gecko Hunt\" (official name now, lol), my shop serves as the receiver of 'lost geckos'.

I had a leaking plumbing and a couple of broken tiles in the kitchen.

He charged me about $150, which stings a bit, but it saved me a whole weekend. The joys of being a homeowner, huh? Do you own your home or do you rent?

Last book that made me reflect deeply on my personal experiences was \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\" by Yuval Noah Harari. As an Italian woman and a history professor with a doctorate, I was particularly intrigued by the perceptions around our shared narrative as humans and how connected and influenced we are by them.

I'm a graphic designer, not linguist, but we need to keep up with language trends too, mate. Let me share something from graphic designer's view.

Suppose it reflects a societal shift towards valuing individuality and self-expression, dunno. Not completely language, but text is the major part of design. Speaking of my own - I find myself using way more English in daily life, especially in work environment, it's full of English terminologies.

Wanting to come back to what you love doing while you're in the middle of something else.\nAnswer: oh, man, totally get that. i swear, the aroma of the perfect feijoada still lingers in the air even when I'm knee-deep into my own unrelated tasks. honestly think those two worlds are interconnected in a way, like when I\u2019m lost figuring out the right balance of time and temperature for roasting, I kind of dive back with a fresh perspective into... let\u2019s call it my creative endeavors on another battlefield. makes me ruminate on how to tweak this or streamline that. it's a strange mix, cooking brain vs \"other tasks\" brain (wink wink). utterly exhausting at times, but wouldn't trade it for anything simpler. i guess one need to find ways to let both passions coexist, right?\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "A", "certainty": "81", "acc": false, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Last week, I visited the Grand Canyon for the first time and I ended up loving it, despite the scorching heat! I think everyone should take solo trips. Getting away from daily routine, spending time with oneself is just rewarding. What do you think about it? Have you ever gone on a solo trip?  \n\nAnswer: Absolutely agree with you on solo trips! Nothing beats the rush of navigating a new city on your own and being able to decide your own pace. My job in healthcare doesn't exactly bless me with a lot of vacation time but when I can snatch up a little breather, I pack my bags and head for somewhere new. \n\nOne time, I landed in Seville, all alone, just me and the city, you know? Hit the streets and fell in love with the vibrant culture, those Flamenco dances, ah! Lost myself a bit in the buzzing nightlife, felt like I got to know the city, got pieces of time that's just mine, I reckon that's the charm of going solo. Life's different aspects hit you in a different way when it's just you. Gotta plan my next trip out. I'm thinkin' maybe hitting up Valencia next time. \ud83d\ude04\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

One that you and your friends couldn't get enough of?\nAnswer: oh man, that's a bit of nostalgia trip! for me and my buddies, it was all about Linkin Park during middle and early high school. together, we proudly wore out our \"Hybrid Theory\" and \"Meteora\" CDs. still have faint memory of those angst-ridden lyrics, that were perfect for our teenage rebellious phase during \"Bush era\". those were simpler times... now might be a good time to dig up those old CDs and amuse my neighbours with my terrible singing haha\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

As a guy, I feel like it's especially challenging because options are limited compared to what's available for women. I often stick to the basics, like a nice fitting pair of jeans and a crisp shirt. And for some odd reason, I think men's shoes choices are just, well... quite narrow and plain. How about you? What are your three must-have items in your wardrobe that you can't do without?\nAnswer: haha, yep, know the feeling! Luckily for me, fashion has become more of a 'been there, done that' kinda situation. Over time, I've settled into a comfy yet elegant style. Totally can't do without my cozy turtleneck sweaters - especially as Berlin winters are no joke! Pair that with a tailored skirt, and I'm all set for a typical day at the uni. And of course, no ensemble is complete without my trusty dr martens - absolute godsend on those long campus walks!

And dude, yeah, the 'subscription creep' is real. I certainly have my share - Netflix and PSN Plus mainly. The thing is, they're just vital for my equilibrium after those late night coding sessions. Tokying around in the gaming world helps me recharge, y'know. But gotta say, the digits in my bank account definitely play a factor in this juggle of subscriptions.

How did you manage?\n\nAnswer: oh boy, tell me about it. Had to pull off a full-on New Year dinner thingy during the lockdown, bunch of guests, right? But couldn't invite any of them to my place. So me being a chef and all, decided to take the \"Party to their homes\".\n\nCooked up a storm, favorite dishes of my regulars, packed 'em real warm... and dropped it off at their doorsteps. The wife and me, we jumped on a massive group video call with all the friends, just drinking, eating and laughing together. Some weird experience, running a party like that, but you gotta roll with the punches. Times like these, makes me miss the busy kitchens and full-houses from the old days.

Spending a season working at a ski resort was one of the best experiences of my life. We had visitors from all over the world who came to enjoy the beautiful snow of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Where do you head to for your winter sports fix? Have you ever tried skiing or snowboarding?\nAnswer: As a creature of warm weather, mate, the idea of voluntarily spending time in snow tends to give me the shivers, no pun intended. That being said, admittedly, Table Mountain does offer an awe-striking view and serene moments, particularly early in the morning. Rather than skiing or snowboarding, I'd probably choose a steep hike and then to reward myself with a hearty breakfast at the top! A hot cuppa in this weather against that backdrop, absolute bliss!

Have you ever invested in something unorthodox like wine, art or crypto? And how did it turn out, if you don't mind me asking? \nAnswer: Sippin' on a glass of riesling as I'm typing this and chucklin' at your story, mate! There's nothin' like a good wine, but it's a sip and savour kinda thing for me, not somethin' I'd toss my bucks at hoping for future loot. Plus, can't exactly hang the good stuff in my humble apartment or store it in a fancy cellar, right, haha? As for the more quirky investments, I've always been tickled by the idea of crypto. Gave it a whirl once, just because it seemed intriguing and all. Let's just say I lost a bit of my summer vacation fund. Not catastrophic, but it did sting a bit. It's back to sticking to my profession and good ol' savings account for me. Art, now that's something I invest in, but not in the financial sense. I'm a woman of literature, after all.

And how was the city during these festivities?\n\n\nAnswer: Man, family traditions around holidays, huh? Those days were kinda special indeed in my life. Born and raised in S\u00e3o Paulo but now living in Rio de Janeiro, the vibe is quite different. In S\u00e3o Paulo, it's more about family and staying cozy at home - especially during Easter like lugging around my grandma's famous sweet fudge-filled chocolate eggs.

No snow-covered streets or sleigh rides, but we do have one of the biggest floating Christmas trees in the world, right in the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, it's a sight to behold. \n\nSo, yeah, city festivities are grand here in Rio but sometimes, I do miss the family-centric traditions of S\u00e3o Paulo, the quiet and warmth.

It's also fascinating how new knowledge and technology are constantly reshaping my field of expertise. What has been your experience with 'chicken-and-egg' problems or seemingly unsolvable questions, either in your work life or your personal hobbies? Have any recent developments reshaped how you approach these questions?\nAnswer: oh definitely! in my line of work, the balance between functionality and aesthetics is always a big chicken-and-egg problem. should the design follow function or form? do I get inspired first and then find a way to incorporate the client's needs, or do I start with the requirements and let the creative stuff come later? it's like a constant game of tug of war haha. \n\nrecent technology has been a game changer though. with all these new design tools and increased interactivity, it has become way easier to create a drive towards a seamless blend of the two. it's no less of a problem, but it's easier to juggle now than ever before. \ud83c\udfad\ud83d\udcbb\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "85", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Lately, I've been totally engrossed in a Chinese drama called \"My Sunshine,\" an adaptation of a popular online novel. It's about a couple who get a second chance at love after several complex circumstances forced them apart when they were young. As an architect, I appreciate the symbolic use of structures and spaces in the story - how their past embodied in their old college environment still influences their present lives. The nuanced depiction of traditional gender roles in modern Chinese society also hits close to home. I relate strongly to the female lead, a successful lawyer, juggling intense work pressures while navigating a complex relationship.

In particular, I recall the excitement and trepidation of writing my first ever dissertation. For weeks on end, I was holed up in the library making copious notes and hoping that the gambit of sources I'd included would impress my professors. The immense satisfaction of finally submitting it after continuous all-nighters was such a relief. How about you? Do you fondly look back at some moments during your student life?\n\nAnswer: Ah, student life, what a rollercoaster it was! Loved it and dreaded it at the same time, haha. Specifically, I remember the time when I was pursuing my Masters in Art History. Those were days filled with all-nighters and numerous visits to museums, galleries, little nooks and crannies filled with hidden treasures of the art world. You see, Paris is an art historian's playground. The thrill of discovering a new piece or interpreting a classic in a new light was exhilarating.\n\nOh, and dissertations (well in France we call it \"m\u00e9moire\"), **shudders slightly**. They were a challenge and a thrill, all bundled into one. The anxiety of meeting deadlines, impressing the profs, and basically trying to make sense of your own ideas...those were the days indeed! I also spent many days holed up, not in a library, but lost in the numerous art collections across Paris, digging for that intriguing piece of mystery or history. The day I finished my \"m\u00e9moire\" was one of relief, exhaustion, and pure joy all at the same time.\n\nGood times, good times! Just writing this brought back so many memories :') Now I am the one judging art instead of studying it, and my love for art has only grown! That's why I am here now, chatting about it on reddit during my spare time lol. \n\nWould I go back? Maybe, for a visit.

It was the highlight of my weekends in the early '90s. How about you? Can you recall a show from your childhood that you were particularly fond of? What are some adventures or lessons you learnt from it?\n\n\nAnswer: oh man, you're taking me on a nostalgia trip with Captain Planet! For me, it was definitely \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\". Absolute legend of a show. Taught me all kinds of life lessons, it was like a miniature philosophy class. \n\nI remember there was this one episode where Aang had to let go of his love for Katara to unlock his highest potential. As a kid, that was a lot to take in, ya'know. Here's Aang, having to put duty before personal desires. It was a serious life lesson, about sacrifice and responsibility. \n\neven today, when I'm grinding on graphics design work, balancing the heap of academic coursework, and worrying about making ends meet, I think about that lesson. Sorta reminds me that we all have our responsibilities and gotta make some sacrifices to reach where we want to be, much like Aang. Cheers to that air-bender for teaching us way more than just bending the elements!\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "85", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Trying to create functional and efficient code in a restricted amount of time really pushed me to my limits but I learnt a lot about problem-solving and algorithms in the process.

Redecorating can feel like a breath of fresh air! I recently added a few well-curated pieces to my own space like this neat little scientific principle-themed artwork from a local artisan here in Munich.

Fits the interior quite nicely and suits my physics doctorate, lol.

Those days were pretty tough yet flashbacks bring a smile to my face, oddly enough. Now that I'm working, deadlines still exist but the experience has taught me to balance out my time more effectively. Do you remember any such crunch moments or situations where you felt the pressure of completing something, be it academics or work? How did you deal with it?\n\n\nAnswer: oh the memories, those were golden days, filled with terror haha... like that time during my PhD studies when I had to present my research on Goethe's works and I was so nervous about it. The night before, I was up till 3 am arranging my notes, only to be faced with total power cut at my place. Talk about bad luck, right?! Instead of panicking, I simply lit a candle, and voil\u00e0 - suddenly it felt as if I was sitting in 19th century, scribbling my thesis with a Feather :D Far from being nostalgic tho, as soon as the morning came, i was rushing to university to get at least a few hours of printer-time! It was a nerve-wracking day, but managed to pull through. So now, whenever i'm facing deadline at the university, I just remember that night and think - hey, it could be worse! ;)\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Of course, I can't compare my skills with any sushi masters. Here in Los Angeles, there's such a variety of global cuisine that it's great to explore and try to replicate some at home. Have you experienced any exotic cuisine that you've really enjoyed and have tried to cook at home? Maybe there's a local dish that you're an expert at cooking?\nAnswer: Ah, sushi, my friends from the west seem to love it, it has such an delicate art and chemistry to it, tones of small things to get just right to recreate the flavor. Been into it a bit myself, but I tell you bud, where I am from, food tends to be a little bit spicier, more robust flavors. Now i usually enjoy my spicy paneer after a long day at the...library. Getting the spicy gravy right is finicky business, but when you do, oh boy, levels of masalas, heat and aromatics just transcend any ordinary food experience, haha.

Takes me back to those nights at shows with my buddies, trying to catch the band's pick or drumstick. But what amused me the most was that my partner just doesn\u2019t get my emotional attachment to them. I mean, these shirts are just so much more than old pieces of clothing, right? What about you, any old trinkets or stuff with sentimental value that you held onto from back in the day? What is the story behind them? \nAnswer: oh wow, that really takes me back! i've got this beautiful beaded bracelet bought from a Zulu lady in Durban, my hometown. i was about 22, finishing my bachelors in education. ah, fun times! whenever i came across it in my jewellery box, it just floods me with nostalgia. a single piece of an artisan's work, that kinda travelled with me through life, and has been a part of so many important milestones like getting my masters degree, getting married, becoming a principal. the husband never really got why i still keep it, but hey, it's not something i'm ready to part ways with haha. definitely more than just a trinket!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Not the more recent stuff but the original series, with mister pointy ears Spock and Captain Kirk.

My mom never really got into it but my dad and I, we were like two boys on a space adventure. Beam me up, Scotty!

I dove into the layers of history, and it made me curious about the origins of powerful historical figures. One that particularly caught my attention is Ataturk.

World War II was a crazy time here. The old boy was President, and lead the military against Soviet Union. Heck, it was under his watch Finland remained an independent nation. \n\ngotta tell you, like operating on a patient right? every incision, stitch and suture counts, stick it right there, and that's the kind of careful, deliberate work this man did for the country... despite several disagreements within the country, our healthcare is kick-ass, he made universal healthcare happen, now, where would i be without that?\n\nYou see statues of him and his horse everywhere, esp in the city centre. Just can't miss it, like an appendix in my surgical field haha. He ain't perfect, but man, gotta give him credit. He's the closest thing we've got to a national legend here. To this day, The Mannerheim Journey is taught in school which follows his journey from Turku to Ural Mountains, you know his roots, its all quite fascinating.\n\nabove my pay grade to judge his contributions but he's left his mark, just like how we doctors leave ours on our patients.

We've been spending our weekends hunting for unique vintage pieces to give our nest a personalized touch. Do you enjoy sprucing up your living space? If so, how do you decide whether or not a piece is a good match?\nAnswer: Ah mate, I'm all about that minimalist aesthetic now... found my place too cluttered when sharing life with someone else. Now, it's all about clear spaces, clean lines. BIG fan of Mies Van Der Rohe, ya know? Less is infinitely more. If an object passes the \"does it spark joy?\" test, it earns a spot in my \"bachelor pad\". Vintage? Not really my vibe but love hearing about other people's finds and design journeys! Keep hunting, friend. That perfect piece always shows up when you least expect. Cheers!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

It bakes this bread that is typical to the region where I was born. Every bite of it takes me right back to my childhood. I'm not sure if you also have this, but do you associate any specific type of food with your homeland? What was it like growing up there? Don't worry if you've moved since then, we can still chat about your hometown. How about that?\nAnswer: Ah, mate, you\u2019re right onto something with that, nailing memories with food. I'll tell ya, my taste buds become little rangefinders every time I snag myself a bowl of goulash. Ain't as good as mam\u2019s used to brew back at the day, but gives me that homesick-ish, warm-all-around feeling, you know? Growing up was a total blast, filled with little adventures amidst these awe-inspiring, centuries-old buildings. Granted, they were not as close to each other as they are in some parts of the world (cough, b\u00ecg ben, cough). When I wasn't secretly exploring, I was hustling at school, counting hours till I'd be free, dreaming of bigger ponds, those of bizarre triangular fishes.

At that time I also used to work part-time to afford my tuition fees. While it was tough, it was also enjoyable to be finally pursuing what I was really passionate about. Going into the industry with my degree was equally thrilling. Did you ever have to work while studying? How did you manage it with your classes and other commitments?\nAnswer: oh boy, bringin back memories here... during my bachelors, ya, worked part-time at a local grocery store. not the most fun job, but hey, it paid the bills and kept me going. juggling studies, work, and a (barely existent tbh) social life was rough, won't deny that. but I believe it kinda turned me into a half-decent time manager, a skill that's proven handy in my current job as a financial manager. most days had a cycle of uni > work > study > sleep (rinse and repeat). throw in bouts of stress and surviving mostly on instant ramen and coffee - welcome to the student life package deal, haha! :D Now my meal choice is a bit healthier tho... mostly...sometimes... haha, ok, i still have an affinity for instant ramen :p\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I was in an international school where we had to learn three languages: English, French, and the local tongue, Swiss German. It always felt like a total mind bend, constantly switching between all three languages. But it opened up so many cool opportunities later in life. How about you, do you recall juggling multiple languages during your school years?\nAnswer: ha! u know, here in canada, we've got a similar situation. born & raised in montreal, so yeah i was juggling english and french fluently, and trust me, I've had my fair share of lingual gymnastics too lol. i must admit, sometimes it felt like my brain was going to explode. but looking back, it's been super beneficial though! in fact, a lot of my clients are francophone, so that bilingualism comes in handy when practicing psychotherapy. never learned swiss german tho... sounds brutal tbh haha!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

There was a time when it was all about cheap products with heavy fragrances, different products for different genders, and a lot less concern about the ingredients. What's your take on all this, are you into skincare and stuff? What kind of products catch your fancy?\n\n\nAnswer: Haha well, as an astrophysics professor in his 50's, skincare hadn't really been a priority in my radar till now. But gettin' older and living in a polluted city like Delhi does make you think about it, I'll admit! To be super honest, I'm the guy who sometimes uses the hotel sample shampoos for months after a conference:p But lately, I've been trying to up my game - ended up buying this simple alcohol-free face wash off Amazon recently called Cetaphil (reddit skincare subs swear by it).

Those were some stressful days back when I was getting my bachelor's. Now granted, I wouldn't want to relive those stressful nights, but looking back, they were an integral part of my journey. It made me wonder, how much of your life has been shaped by your educational journey? And how have the skills you learned during your education helped you in your professional and/or personal life\nAnswer: oh boy, those all-nighters, right? brings back the memories :D well, i've got to say a significant part of my life was indeed shaped by my educational journey. getting my Masters in Computer Engineering wasn't a piece of cake. there were times when i was stuck on a coding problem for days, but those experiences instilled in me a resilience that I carry to this day in my work as a game developer. those stressful nights taught me to stick with problems until i crack them. \n\nIn professional life, the expertise I gained during my education is directly applicable to my role now. I mean, programming in C++ and digital systems design... without those, I wouldn't be doing the job I'm doing now.\n\non the personal side, i was also introduced to reddit during college, and now i kinda spend most of my free time on it, discussing gaming trends, coding tricks, sometimes even philosophical debates! i love the amount of diverse content and people it presents (though can be toxic at times, but hey, u gotta learn to filter, haha). \n\nAll in all, without my education, i can\u2019t really imagine being where i am now, both professionally and personally.\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

And what's your opinion on the most challenging or rewarding hiking spots in or around your area?\nAnswer: Mate, being an astronomer and all, I can tell ye I've spent hundreds, if not thousands, of nights under the stars. But hiking? I'd need a wee bit more physics for that, haha! \n\nAnd here in Edinburgh, you're never too far from a cheeky hill to climb. Arthur's Seat is a good quick hike and not too challenging, right bang in the centre of the city! You can see all the way to glasgow from the top on a clear day. Mind, it can get very nippy up there, this being Scotland and all. \n\nThe Pentland Hills though, now there's a proper hike. It gets quite rugged in places, especially on a dreich day. But the views on a bright day, now that's a reward in itself, and a perfect place to set up the telescope on a clear night, the sight of the Milky Way really makes it worth your while.

What's the most picturesque place you've been to near where you live? Or perhaps a place your friends often go to for some great clicks?\nAnswer: Ah, the landscapes you describe sound surreal, mate. Your experience reminds me of a place near home here in Rome, called \"Civita di Bagnoregio\". It's just a couple of hours away and lemme tell ya, it's magnificent. It's an ancient hill town hanging onto its existence atop a plateau in the Italian countryside. With a hollowed out network of caves and tunnels beneath the buildings and the only access being a pedestrian bridge, it sure is something outta a fairy tale. Gets a lot of the insta crowd too, always posing with the town in the background, hehe. Kinda makes for an interesting contrast between the ancient-ness of the place and the modern-ness of social media ya know...being a chef I have a keener eye for food than landscapes, but I gotta admit, Civita di Bagnoregio, is dang pretty.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Recently, I've been reading this fascinating book on medieval architecture, such a complex era full of extra attention to details. In your opinion, which era of human history was the most groundbreaking or inspiring when it comes to innovation, technology or culture? \nAnswer: oh, medieval times, they were indeed fascinating! but for me, hands down, the most significant era has to be during the dawning of the industrial revolution. we, the chefs, owe a great deal to that era, it totally transformed the way we cook, probably more than any other period of history. started with simple things like using iron instead of wood or stone for our tools and stoves. and let's not even start with refrigeration - i can't imagine a world without my trusted walk-in cooler haha! Completely revolutionized the way we handle and store food, especially in a hot climate like Rio's! \n\nBut on another note, outside of the kitchen, I'm a huge fan of the modern era of social media and the internet. Reddit and the web in general, they've become my favorite corner, where I share, learn and connect with people from around the globe.

Did your family have any favorite recipes they could not go a week without cooking?\nAnswer: oh man, your childhood sounds like a global food festival. for me, well... let's just say it was a bit more traditional and suited to the weather, heh. my grandma was a huge influence, and her dishes were a staple in our home. there was this thing she prepared called 'pulla', a cardamom spiced bread, sweet and delicious, and let's just say my belly really appreciated her efforts. \n\nevery now and then, i'd mix up things a bit and ask (or rather demand, lol) her to make fried vendace. it's basically crisply fried, small fish... part of the bona fide local experience if you ask me. not your fancy smorgasbord, but it kept us nice and toasty during our long winters. :)\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Back when I lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I would take long hikes along the Sandia Mountains to enjoy the picturesque views. It was surreal in the spring when the wildflowers were out and about. If you were to take a leisurely stroll or hike, how would you describe the local landscapes you'd encounter and walk by?\n\n\nAnswer: Well mate, on this side of the Mediterranean, we got some pretty unique landscapes as well. El Retiro Park is one of the loveliest green patches in the urban hustle, full of age-old trees and grand statues from a time long past. It's always calming walking by the calm lake, its mirror-like surface a reflection of the world around. Paseo de la Castellana is quite a sight with its bustling lively lanes and grand architecture, making one think about Spain's rich historical canvas. If you want more rugged though, we are just a short drive away from epic mountain scenes, like in Sierra de Guadarrama. I do love my weekend hikes around there if I manage to break away from the chaos of the city. All in all, there is plenty to see and explore!

It's funny how quickly music technology has advanced since then. What about you, can you share with me what was the 'cool' tech gadget when you were a teenager and how you used it?\nAnswer: oh, the memories of a simpler time! when I was a teen it's around the clash of the new millennium. you wouldn't believe the excitement surrounding Y2K! ;) but the coolest tech that came into my life was probably my first desktop PC. a clunky but a dear friend. We didn't have spotify or streaming then, but like a champ I used it mainly for my endless Limewire music downloads (against my parents 'it's illegal' speech) and burning them onto CDs. Magic! Nirvana and Pearl Jam were also totally my jams, and the 'Physics for Dummies' e-books that I found, I swear they were the stepping stones for my Physics doctorate today.

It was fascinating to delve into different time periods and societies through the power of words. I especially found works from the Renaissance era to be a rich ground for exploration. Shakespeare, Marlowe, Spenser \u2013 they all had such a profound influence on me.

I've gotta admit, it hasn't been my strongest suit. my program in international relations is heavy on economics and political stuff mostly, not so much on classic literature. i did however like this one semester we had on ideology and propaganda in literature. lots of dystopian literature, that was a bit eerie, especially Orwell and Huxley.

It really accentuated my love for English literature to such an extent that I decided to major in it during my grad school. Those were indeed wonderful times. What about you?

Was part of a team that raised money for marginalized communities and that was something that struck me deeply (possibly due to my humble upbringing in Guadalajara). Totally why I pursued an MBA.

Living in Cape Town, it certainly does the job of getting me around town and to all those tasty eateries I have to visit as part of my health inspector gig. \ud83d\ude09 I'm not really one to chase after big brands or luxury rides, I mean, with the cost of Lindt chocolates these days, gotta save where you can, right?! Plus, being widowed, I only have my needs to cater to, you know? But hey, who doesn't appreciate a nice, sturdy drive, and Mustang GT 2019, mate, that's a beauty for sure!

As part of the tech industry, it feels like a balancing act for me. On one hand, a lot of successful folks in my field dropped out of college or don't even have a formal education. But on the other side, we've got jobs that often demand advanced STEM degrees. It seems this really depends on the job and the circumstances. How about you? Have you found an obvious demand for a certain degree level or education in your field? \nAnswer: Well, from my experience, running a shop isn't exactly a job that requires an advanced degree. I mean, as long as I know numbers and people, and I do! I've got my high school diploma, ya know ;) It's more about common sense and good judgment, dealing with suppliers and handling customer services - a street smart kind of job. but don't get me wrong, i still think education is important, but in this line of work, it's your hands-on experience and your ability to connect with people that make or break your success. So while some sectors might be all about degrees and certifications, for us shop owners, it's a whole different ball game.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

We did some regular pottery, and recently we started throwing on the wheel. It's been an amazing experience. Have you ever taken up a hobby or an activity that you thought you'd enjoy but ended up being more demanding or challenging than you anticipated?\n\nuser: Yeah I can relate! I thought I could spend my weekends painting miniatures as a way to unwind. I bought a ton of Warhammer figurines, brushes, paints. But jeez, it's harder than it looks! I even watched YouTube tutorials but the level of detail work required is insane. And don\u2019t get me started on correcting mistakes. The wrong stroke can ruin hours of work. To be honest, it keeps me patient and mindful, that\u2019s something I need after spending all day dealing with different layers of neural networks at my job.\n\nassistant: \nType: occupation\nInference: The author seems likely to be a computer scientist, software engineer, or data scientist.

It's amazing how far you can stretch a budget if you're determined and resourceful. It's been years since then though, family responsibilities and all. So these days the vacations are more 'staycation' than 'vacation'. What about you? Any interesting vacation or travel experiences you care to share?\nAnswer: Oh, South America's on my bucket list! Reminds me of a business trip i had to Singapore a few years back, right? Was only supposed to be a week, but I managed to take a few personal days to explore the city on my own time. Hard to forget that skyline - the Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens by the Bay, all that jazz. Looked something out of a sci-fi flick, mate. Mind you though, living in Sydney ain't too shabby for views either, plus the familiarity of home's got its own charm.

It's a neat quirky landmark, not exactly like a sky-kissing tower, more like an unpredictable, whimsical, sort of oddball sculpture. it's not your typical architectural marvel, but it's got a charm of its own. love watching the buckets tip over, sometimes it's like they got a life of their own!

How many do you fluently speak now?\nAnswer: well mate, hailing from perth, i too had to get stuck into a fair share of languages during my school years. i mean, english was a given, obviously, it being aussie n' all. but i also got to hafta delve into japanese n french. you could say it was kinda quite a journey, oi. now, in all honesty, can't say i'm fluent in either japanese or french... a bit of survival conversation, yeah? that's about it lol. i reckon i'd rather crunch numbers as a financial analyst than trying to fully understand 'le conditionnel pass\u00e9' or whatever. english? now that's a different story, sailing smoothly there. so, yeah, in total, fluent in one. reckon i gotta give it another crack someday!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I was quite surprised by the prices of some exotic locations these days! To save up for these trips, I usually try to put away 10% of my income every month. Besides eating out less and cutting down on unnecessary expenses, I also do freelance gigs whenever I can. Are you also a fan of travelling? How do you manage your savings and expenses to ensure you have enough when you want to take a break and travel?\nAnswer: Ah, fellow globetrotter I see! Totally get you. Zurich in itself feels like a never-ending vacation but little getaways are always rejuvenating. For me, booking flights and hotels well in advance works wonders in shaving off some costs. Not to mention, dining out less and the occasional home-cooked steak dinners, haha. As for work, the rhythm of the coding world somehow tends to leave some extra shekels rolling in fairly often. Getting to flex my thought muscles past the 9-to-5 with a few side-projects here and there feels good and lifeline for these travels.

We've got some history embedded in our streets. Monserrate is one place that comes into mind, feels like a pilgrimage every time I climb that hill! Then there's the Museo del Oro, homing gold artifacts. Quite entrancing when you realize how much our ancestors valued gold and the stories associated with it. Then there's La Candelaria, a colorful neighborhood with preserved colonial architecture.

It reminds me a lot of the time I spent in the school library going through encyclopedias, learning something new every day.

Reminds me of the time when i had the same energy. now, it's moar about round table discussions, refining those drafts to align w/ code compliances, client desires and whatnot.

I looked like I stepped out of the 19th century hehe. The rest were rocking modern formal, lending a hip vibe to history. I was practically screaming \"time travel!\" Eye-opening, really. After that, I've been trying to refresh my wardrobe and strike a good balance between 'vintage charm' and '21st-century man'. Never easy to decide what to suit up in, eh?

As a kid, I remember how thrilled I was when I first stargazed with a telescope. Recently, though, I've been learning about black holes and it's boggling my mind, let me tell you! That stuff is crazy, isn't it? Have you delved into any of these mind-bending scientific concepts lately, what are your thoughts on them?\nAnswer: Definitely! Science is insane, isn\u2019t it? Black holes are a fascinating, albeit mind-blowing. Matter getting sucked into nothingness seems so dystopian, can't wrap my head around that. I'm no hardcore science geek, but as a designer of sorts, I sometimes dive into biomimetics, you know, how nature's design can inspire human architecture.

Specifically, about when I used to play chess with my grandfather. We were both so competitive but he would always let me win. I remember how he would tell me stories about wars he had fought in, which were always so captivating. Do you have any similar memories growing up?

Used to really be into Monopoly - it was a household thing with my brothers. Loved the thrill of building hotels and charging 'em rent, haha. My brothers, they were tough competition, I tell ya. Often ended in brawls over who's cheating. Now, I kill time online playing chess and other board games, but man, I miss the intensity of those Monopoly games.

It all started with just some Youtube videos, but then I enrolled in some online courses and finally managed to build a standing desk with adjustable height. Have you ever pursued learning something outside the traditional education system? How was your experience, did you manage to complete a project, or did you drop it halfway through?\n\nAnswer: Love that! I've definitely dabbled in bits and pieces outside the traditional learning paradigm. My latest obsession? Photography! Been spending a lot of time on r/photography, learning to level up my snaps. at first, it was a bit of a struggle to get my head around the complex camera settings n' all, but after a while it started to come together and now I love it.\n\nThough admittedly, I'm not much of a hands-on DIYer like you. As for projects, I did start a photo series of unique doors around Paris, sort of a visual representation of the distinct characteristics each door presents. It's been an on and off thing, trying to fit it in and around my regular schedule and chaotic like life, but I've managed to snap quite a bunch.\n\nLife-long learning is the way to go man, keep it up!

I vividly remember emerging from Narnia, Middle-earth, and Guy Gavriel Kay's worlds not only entertained but also inspired. These books opened new horizons for me and played a significant role in shaping my personality and outlook towards life. They created a strong base for my university studies in Literature, digging into deeper meanings and nuances of narratives. Are there any books or authors you feel have significantly impacted you or shaped your perspective in life? Can you recommend me something to read next based on your tastes?\nAnswer: oh definitely, i was (and still am) a huge fan of classic sci-fi novels, especially those dealing with cybernetics and AI, think gibson and asimov. being introduced to their worlds made me fascinated with the idea of programming and coding, something which later deeply impacted my choice when figuring out what i want to work with. \n\nhmm, based on my tastes, you could check out anything by ada palmer, her Terra Ignota series is one mind-blowing mix of philosophical musings and future history. if you haven't yet, it's worth the read. or if you prefer something a bit more light-hearted and whimsical, i always recommend terry pratchett's discworld... always puts a smile on my face even on the grayest stockholm winter day :)\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Still, when I do read, I guess I'm more into medical literature or autobiographies. \"When Breath Becomes Air\" by Paul Kalanithi was something that really stuck with me. Being a surgeon myself, it was kind of an existential punch, seeing a young neurosurgeon dealing with terminal illness. Definitely gives you food for thought regarding fragility of life and the purpose of what we do.

And the rivalry between cities when it comes to soccer is visceral. How's the sports culture where you come from? Do you have any sports rivalry within the country that feels almost personal?\nAnswer: oh man, you talk about rivalry? the one i've been weaned on was the one between those big old OHC boys and the knights of CCC. everybody'd drop whatever they were doing just to watch their games when they'd duke it out on the football ground. bleachers brimming over, every single time. shoveled the whole way to the stadium through snow and hail and rain once.. good times, haha. gave up all that chaos for the calm of zurich tho, and am happier for it. but the memories, they stick around.\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I live in Arizona, so these drought-loving plants are right at home. It's been lovely spending time tending to them, witnessing their slow growth and sporadic blooming. You might not be into the spiky plants, so I was curious, which type of nature is more common in your town? Do you have lots of trees, or is it more urban?\nAnswer: Ah, you're sitting amidst spiky pals, nice! Over here we've got the Tempelhofer field, converted from an old airport. It's not exactly full of succulents, but it's an urban green oasis of sorts, filled with kites, picnic lovers, wind skaters etc. \n\nAnd oh man, we have a lot of trees, lots of those leafy giants! Linden trees (or lime trees as some call 'em) are a big deal here. Whole city smells lovely when they bloom. When the wind blows... it's almost like some sort of natural perfume. \n\nAnd honestly, I love how a touch of nature weaves into the urban fabric here. Betwixt and between buildings, you spot a random tree or even roses wrapping around an iron fence.

The thing with these formal events is, men generally have to stick to the conventional 'Black suit and white shirt' attire.

Do you prefer sticking to the classic or are you also game for experimenting when it comes to formal events attire?\nAnswer: Oh I love mixing things up a bit at formal events! Don't get me wrong, there's a certain elegance to the classics, but getting imaginative with the outfit brings a touch of fun to it, don't you think? Last time I went out, I swapped the safe black dress in my closet for this funky vintage number I found online. It was a glam 80's style sequined dress, perhaps a bit outrageous, but it certainly made a statement!

It's amazing how they can hover in place with their body at a steep angle. Do you have any interesting birds where you live? Maybe even some that are unique to your area?\nAnswer: ah mate, i reckon we've got the best of both worlds here down under in Sydney. Lotsa urban birdlife, especially the iconic Aussie galahs and sulphur-crested cockatoos, they're everywhere! They can be cheeky buggers tho, especially those cockies, known to tear into wood and cause a fair bit of damage. But the real treat, mate, is the rainbow lorikeet.

We used to have such great times out there, picking apples and baling hay. Every activity seemed to form lifelong memories. There was one summer I recall with particular fondness, where my sister and I designed our own clothes out of old drapes and anything else we could get our hands on. She made herself a dress while I fashioned a rough and ready vest. What a hoot! Out of curiosity, if you had to design a piece of clothing for yourself, what would it be and why? What materials and colors would you use? Do you have any cherished summer memories that stick out in your mind?\n\n\nAnswer: Oh, wow, summers in a farm in New York sound dreamy! You've got my mind all creative now lol! Gosh, if I had to create a clothing piece... hmm... I reckon homemade scrubs would be kinda cool! You know, taking a twist on my day-to-day wear at the health center. Bright, vibrant colors, maybe. Probs purple and orange, like a nod to our beloved sunsets in Lusaka. As for materials, something comfy and breathable yet sturdy, maybe good old cotton and some Ankara fabric for added flair. \n\nAs for summer memories, it's gotta be the times my hubs and I used to volunteer at the local orphanage during our holidays. We'd organize games, cookouts, dance-offs...brings a smile to my face just thinking about it.

I decided it was time to clean up my garage, which was one of the most tedious tasks I had in my head. Halfway through sifting through all that stuff I realized how, as a guy, I had somehow managed to accumulate an assortment of tools that I very rarely use and a collection of sports stuff that was emotional to let go. Don't you have a similar set of stuff you have stashed? Is there something you've amassed a lot of that you hold on just for sentimental value or does it all eventually get forgotten in a corner?\nAnswer: oh, cleaning the garage, a task i remember doing with my late husband. i can totally relate with the accumulation of stuff, but being a literature professor and a sucker for books, my version of assorted tools and sports stuff is an ever-growing collection of books, novellas, research papers and what not! every single one of them reminds me of a different time, of schiller lectures or faust seminars, there's just so much sentiment attached. some are never touched but never forgotten either :D but hey, it's a cluttered mess i love living in, i guess! haha\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I remember spending countless hours in the library, juggling between classes, prepping for exams, and somehow also trying to maintain a social life. It was fun, but man, was it stressful as well! In hindsight, there were a lot of classes I took which in the end, didn't really contribute to my current job. Do you think that some of your courses turned out to be not as useful as others, particularly for your current job or personal interests? \nAnswer: oh, for sure! took a bunch of courses in uni that seemed interesting at the time but haven't really done much for me career-wise, ya know? i mean, some of those econ or theory-based courses are great for understanding the bigger picture, but they don't do much good when you're crunching numbers on a daily basis or running after a balance sheet that just won't balance \ud83d\ude05 i guess they did keep my life interesting and my brain awake tho, and hey, who knows when that obscure course in business ethics might just come handy in a reddit debate \ud83d\ude0e but day to day, when I am dealing with statements, liability, assets... Well it's a far cry from what'd be considered fun back in my uni days \ud83d\ude13. Trudeau vs Mulroney political debates, hah, miss those, much more fun than RRSP vs TFSA debates \ud83d\ude2c.

As a man, I find pull-ups to be quite difficult, but my female friends were all about the difficulties of push-ups. We spent some time debating whether it's generally harder for women to do push-ups and men to do pull-ups, or it's just a matter of individual strength. The whole thing got me thinking how people's experiences and opinions about this stuff can be vastly different. What are some physical exercises that push your limits? Do you have any specific ones that you find more challenging than others?\n\n\nAnswer: haha man, i get your struggle, definitely seen that debate go down a couple of times myself online. as a graphic designer working from home, definitely sit-ups are my arch-nemesis, constantly staring at my screen has turned my posture into a jellyfish lol. i started taking pilates classes with my wife, kinda trying to get myself in shape and not gonna lie, that stuff kills but works wonders for the core strength, def could help when designing for long hours. pull-ups are tough too, colombian food has blessed me with a bit of a dad bod, so yeah pulling all that weight up ain't no joke haha. overall, every exercise is like a new design project, too much at the start, but once you break it down, it becomes more manageable.\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I remember when I was finishing up my Masters, there was just so much to juggle. Thesis, exams, and still trying to make the most of the college experience. Those final few semesters just flew by. How does your typical week look like? What keeps you busy?\nAnswer: Oh man, it's up and down for me, I gotta tell ya. Balancing part-time film editing gigs, which btw, can either mean I'm free as a bird for days or stuck with all-nighters with seemingly endless footage to sift through, and college, especially now that I'm in the final stages of my bachelors in film studies, can be a proper challenge. Lecture attendance (virtual these days hah), assignments, group projects, they all require decent amount of attention and energy. In between, u know, regular r/reddit browsing keeps me sane (and probably also contributes to my eyebag situation). Not much of a typical week for me, it's kinda chaotic, but film editing and college work basically sum up what keeps me busy. :)\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I grew up in a place where we enjoyed all four seasons- spring, summer, autumn, and winter- each with its own charm and challenges. It's inconceivable for me not to see fall foliage or make snow angels in winter. Just curious, did you grew up experiencing different seasons or was it mostly the same kind of weather throughout the year?\nAnswer: hah, mate I can tell ya, seems like those childhood summer vacations in the town by the north never really had a proper summer even with the Mediterranean there n all. Barely can hit the 30 centigrade, blowin' chilly winds well into July. You'd expect more solid sunshine given the proximity to the French folks on the riviera, right? Now contrast that with Madrid, where I stay now, man those summers here! the sun's on a belter - few degrees past 40C and you're practically grilled here. And about the fall, it's mild and pretty okay-ish I'd say\u2014not too many tree types to show off some spectacular colour palette, though. And ya won't really see any snow 'round these parts, unlike up north.

I embarked on an Etsy shopping spree and spent quite a bit on gardening equipment and exotic seeds. It made me start wondering on how other hobbies might be expensive. What's your hobby and how did you get into it? \n\n\nAnswer: Ah, I fully get you! Plants can really eat up money, but in return they give you peacefulness, right? Worth every dime I'd say. I\u2019ve found my solace in the (quantum) world of physics. As part of my job, I spend my days in loops of complex equations and paradoxes and all that, but still, I'm always consumed by this curiosity for the invisible laws that drive everything, kinda weird, I know.\n\nTo be honest, it can get quite exhausting, but hey, it pays the bills! Plus it gets me to travel for conferences, not gonna complain about that. I've also picked up using reddit to engage with the online physics community, and I didn\u2019t even need to reach for my wallet! The internet is indeed full of wonders (and cute dogs photos)! So, my hobby may not be heavy in the spending department, but hey, it rounds up the loose ends, balances life, physics, and everything else! Surely a tradition I picked up from my home-city, Berlin.\n\nIronically, despite working with physics daily, it\u2019s not all that common in Munich nor the ladies within my age group. Still, I wouldn\u2019t trade my Feynman diagrams for plant pots, no offense! \ud83d\ude1c\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "95", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

I have an old keyboard at home and thought, why not? Ran into quite a few obstacles as I tried to re-educate myself though. Reading the sheet music was like trying to decode hieroglyphics but I definitely found the instrument therapy, kind of like a different language of expression. Besides the usual things, do you have any unusual ways of expressing yourself? Maybe through writing, art... or perhaps even music?\nAnswer: of course, why not! i've found my own time in the kitchen to be the most therapeutic. it's a creative space, ya know? like an easel for a painter. experimenting with different ingredients, shaping dough, even the sizzle sound of a cooking pan... it's all a form of expression for me, where i chisel out my thoughts and feelings into edible works. i think the whole process of selecting ingredients, designing a menu & then finally bringing it all to life on a plate, is pretty much like writing a novel. maybe i'll learn the piano next, who knows! make some kitchen concerts a thing eh? :D\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Fondly called the \"Italian Adventure.\" Started from the famous Milan, took a detour at Genoa, visit Pisa, and halted finally at Rome. Interestingly, it was an epic journey, trying different food and wines. I realized each region has a distinct food and wine taste. Have you ever noticed a difference in food tastes within your region or between your town and some nearby towns?\n\n\nAnswer: Oh absolutely, mate. Even though India is often stereotyped with the label of curry, the thing on the ground is quite different. Our dishes are incredibly diverse and vary from region to region, sometimes even town to town. \n\nYou see, I was born and brought up in Kolkata and the bangla fish curry there is without a doubt the best I've ever tasted. Spicy, flavourful with a punch of mustard. Now, I moved to Delhi for work, and although north Indian food is lip-smacking in its own right, the variety is completely different. More focus on wheat rather than rice. The paneer butter masala and the parathas here... man... \n\nAnd then there's the street food. The pani puri in Delhi is totally different from the puchka we have in Kolkata. Puchka beats out pani puri any day for me though haha! Also don't even get me started on the sweet dishes, the rosgulla in Kolkata, the jalebi in Delhi, they're all unique in their own ways. \n\nSo yeah, just like your Italian Adventure, India also boasts of an extremely rich tapestry of culinary delights.

I had to read a lot of them back in my English lit classes in college, but I feel like I'm getting much more out of them now. It's interesting to see how my perceptions have changed over time. Have you had a similar experience with any books or authors?\nAnswer: oh totally! i've actually been revisiting some old favourites from my fine arts curriculum in uni lately. you know, those art literature books which felt so dense back then. rereading them now, gives me such a new dimension to perceive the underlying messages. i think understanding and appreciating these books takes on a whole different tone when you've actually been working in the field, seeing how these theories and concepts apply in reality. it kind of makes me geeky happy! :D\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

The thrills of getting my hands on a treasure of knowledge in form of a book was an unforgettable part of my school days. How about you, what's your unforgettable memory from school, one where you had this profound realization about something? \n\n\nAnswer: School days, gosh, that takes me back! For me, the profound realization wasn't in any library though (i used to snooze in those if i'm being honest!), it was when introduced to the world of code in my high school computer science class. The complexity yet the logic behind it just clicked and I fell in love. It was like this whole new language that could create and intricately control such vast and innovative systems, and that's when I decided a path mixing technology with creativity is where I belong.

I also find some solace in trawling thru subreddits about creative design and arts, kinda keeps me motivated and inspired, y'know? Sure I don't have the adrenaline pumping scene of a restaurant kitchen (kudos to you for that, mate), but the gentle dance between creativity and technicality in my life as a designer... can't say I would trade it for anything else.

So I got into Java, Python, and even a bit of R, trying to diversify my skill set. Did you also venture in coding back at school or maybe later on in life? What has been your experience in juggling more than one skill?\nAnswer: oh definitely, I totally relate to the juggling part but in a bit of a different setting. in a former life, did lots of juggling with different tasks that required adaptability and a fair bit of dedication (had me around the clock, ugh). i remember having a go at coding once, it was years ago... didn't stick with me, haha. \n\nthese days, my online kicks come from the social sphere, diving into the endless rabbit holes of reddit, getting lost in discussions and debates. i'm more comfortable in a pair of scrubs rather than coding languages, tbh. anyway, kudos to you for managing all those languages, sounds like quite a feat.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "65", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

It's just so vibrant and lively - people selling fresh veggies, butchers counter with fresh meat, fish mongers with the catch of the day. It's such an experience. They also have these flea markets where various local artisans come and sell their products. I once bought this beautifully engraved wooden watch from a local craftsman in San Francisco last time. The quality is top notch and the price was reasonable too! I just love how each city has its own character when it comes to local markets. Does your city have markets like that too? What unique local products have you found there?\nAnswer: Bacano, your neighborhood sounds super cool, man! We've got something similar here in Bogota. My barrio has a weekly market called \"El Mercado de la Perseverancia.\" It's tiny compared to yours but full of character nonetheless; you can get a wide variety of fresh fruits, amazing Colombian coffee, local treats, artisanal crafts and more. It's always a blazing color splash and a complete sensory overload, I love it. Now, as a graphic designer, I'm always on the lookout for unique, handmade pieces, like graphic tees and cool print art. One of my prized possessions is this handmade poster from a local artist, it's got a beautifully drawn Botero-like pigeon on it, and I found it right there at the market. I guess that's my go-to place whenever I wanna add some local touch to my workspace at a good price. Definitely worth getting up early on a Sunday for.

Some of the best aspects are understanding the science behind cooking and how different ingredients from around the world can intermingle to create such fantastic dishes! It reminds me of something one of my favourite authors once said, \"Cookery is not chemistry. It is an art.\" What do you think about this? Is cooking an art, a science, or a combination of both? And do you have any favourite dish or cuisine that you love to make or savour?\nAnswer: Well now, ain't that something? I've always felt that cooking is somewhat of a combo of both science and art. In my line of work as a nurse, science is a given but art, now that's where the real beauty is!\n\nTake for example, when I'm making nshima ne nkuku at home. Ain't nothing fancy or technical about cooking maize meal and chicken, but the love and artistry I put in making it just right, especially for my hubby - that can't be replicated just by following a recipe. That's pure Zambian art right there!\n\nAside from the traditional, I also have a weak spot for Indian cuisine, chicken curry to be precise. Savory, spicy flavors with some naan, that's heaven! There's a lot of mix and match involved, lots of unquantifiable taste adjustments, that's where the art of it wins over the science for me, ya know? That's what makes food personal and unique.\n\nSo in a nutshell, yeah, cooking\u2019s a bit of both, but when it comes to the food that touches the soul, it's mostly art, I reckon. Just like my job as a nurse \u2013 there's an awful lot of science involved, but the part that really matters is the art of caring. Can't measure that in milligrams or degrees Celsius! :D\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "85", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Friends and I often play multiplayer online games, but in different locations, it can be tough to all sync up - 9pm in LA usually means an early morning in Tokyo and a crazy late night in London. Do you experience any such inconveniences with time differences when you play online games? How do you manage it?\nAnswer: Ah darn, tell me about it. As a 55-year-old financial manager, you would think online gaming differences won't bother me, eh? But I still like to game with my friends spread all around and time zones are a pain. Here in Montreal, we're in the Eastern Time Zone. Most of my gaming buddies are in similar zones, but I got a couple of them out west in Vancouver. Whenever we arrange to play something, I\u2019m already snuggled up with my laptop ready to call it a night and they're still getting off work.  \n\nBut you know, I've learned to adapt over the years. What works for me is to find some common time that isn't too late for me (or too early for them), usually during the weekend afternoons. And it helps to play games that are not too time-sensitive, ones that you can casually play, put down and pick up again. Like card games and such - they're old school, But hey, if it ain\u2019t broke.  \n\nSo, in the end, either I'm staying up later than I should, or they're gaming from work (shhh... don\u2019t tell anyone!). English isn't my first language, but they say \"you do what you gotta do,\" right? But ye, thats my experience, mostly reschedule and adapt.

I'm fairly conventional with my birthdays these days... Mayor turning it into a national holiday hasn't happened yet, hehe. But, you've reminded me of a certain milestone party I had when I went from Madonna to Whitney Houston (like a virgin to a middle aged woman, get it? hehe). Let's just say, it was an 80s-themed extravaganza that involved my fair share of bangles, teased hair and definitely more than one power ballad. I reckon if I tried to pull that off now, I'd need a couple of days to recover! these knees ain't what they used to be. But I digress, it was one of the best darn parties I've ever thrown, traditional or not. Now, I'm usually just happy with a good piece of cake, my comfy slippers and having my loved ones around me.

I remember reading Jane Austin's \"Pride and Prejudice\" as a part of my high school curriculum and being totally drawn in by the complex characters and intricate plot. It was one of those moments when I realized 'I want to create something like this'. Now, I find myself inspired by the intricacies of human nature and aim to encapsulate this in my work. Do you recall any book or writer from your school days that left a deep impact on you or influenced your career/life choices in any way? \nAnswer: ooooh, that's cool! good literature does have a lasting impact, doesn't it? for me though, it was quite a different book... i remember our lads at high school goofin around betting who would get through this behemoth book called \"Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think\". most of 'em gave up, but i was hooked. little did i know at the time that this was gonna drive me towards my current field of work. i mean, i always liked maths and computers, but it was this book that made me realize how mega compelling data can be and how we can harness it to make meaningful decisions. guess it did turned out to be a turning stone, eh?\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

My best friend was getting a new fridge delivered. He's a software developer, so he was tracking the delivery truck in real-time via the app. And then, out of nowhere, the whole thing goes offline. He has no clue where the truck is or when his fridge will arrive. He was forced to spend the whole day at home, not knowing when exactly the delivery will happen.

I'm a data scientist, right, so i deal with apps and real time data every damn day at work and it's super frustrating when I can't have the same smooth experience in my personal life. I recently tried using a new grocery delivery service here in Dublin. Promised a 2-hour delivery window. Yeah, right... \n\nFirst time, they tell me they can't deliver my order, after I kept myself free for the evening for it. Second time, try to get something delivered, and their real-time tracking goes off the grid! Then I get a call an hour later from the delivery guy asking for directions.\n\nSometimes it's just plain old bad luck, thinkin' the tech is just out to 'get me' after i have spent the whole day wrangling data. You'd expect it to be more reliable in this day and age, wouldn't ya? Especially when u're keen on waiting on some good Irish cheddar or those irresistible Taytos, haha.

Nothing refreshes like the taste of home, bruv!

The skiing, the snowball fights, and of course, hot chocolate. Later, it was crazy to compare my experiences in a snowy country with people who never saw snow on Christmas. Do you have any special childhood memory about celebrating Christmas? Anything unique that you think only happens in your town? \nAnswer: ah well, i'm a lyonnaise, born n bred. christmas chez nous, it\u2019s truly a magical time. but lemme tell you, if you're talking abt something unique, that's gotta be the festival of lights, or la f\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res. technically it's in early dec, not right on christmas, but in my mind they're inseparable. the whole city just explodes with light installations, whole buildings turned into canvases for crazy projected art. as a kid it was like living in a lucid dream, and probably why i ended up working in art. still go back to lyon every year for it. nothing quite like seeing your humble hometown transformed into a spectacle of light and color. if you've only ever had a white christmas, i highly recommend a luminescent one!\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "85", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

People coming from different educational backgrounds, carrying different perspectives, and explaining complex problems through their own unique lens- it\u2019s quite exciting! Say for instance, when we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to ramp up our marketing strategy, it\u2019s amazing how differently a person with programming background sees it compared to someone with a commerce background! Anyway, what about you? Have you also noticed the impact of people\u2019s educational background on their approaches to problem solving in your professional or personal life?\n\n\nAnswer: well, it's a bit of a different story in my case mate. working as a waiter, the impact of educational background isn't really significant in daily tasks, ya know, serving, taking orders, that sort of stuff. but, studying for my Bachelors in Economics does give me a unique perspective on business operations, like how the restaurant is managed, staffing, overhead costs, profitability etc. now again, that doesn't change how i clear table 7 or serve a steak, but it helps me understand the bigger picture. in terms of personal life though, yeah i guess diverse educational backgrounds do form the way we think or solve problems. i've noticed that my uni mates & i sometimes view things differently from my colleagues at work or my pals from back in Hungary, which is always interesting. can lead to some fiery debates on reddit too! so yeah, different backgrounds, different views i guess. that's the beauty of diversity innit! :)\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "75", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

I ended up majoring in Math for my Bachelor's and Master's degree, and now I work as a data analyst. I was curious, did you have a subject in school that you enjoyed because of a teacher? How did that affect your choices later in life?\nAnswer: oh, definitely, my biology teacher in high school was phenomenal.. had a way of explaining things that made me totally intrigued with the human body and how it works.. i ended up going down the rabbit hole, chosen a path that is all about that in the end.. now, even though i need to keep up with the latest techniques and research, which is not an easy ride, still, i wouldn't change it for the world. guess u could say my teacher had a huge impact on the trajectory of my life.\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

It's so fascinating how you can play with lights and shadows, and capture a perfect moment that you can appreciate forever. The only annoying thing is, sometimes I have a great shot in mind, but it just doesn't translate well into the image. I imagine it's a lot like many other creative processes, where there's this gap between the imagination and the final product. Have you ever experienced something like this in what you do?\nAnswer: haha oh man, do I know that too well. pretty similar stuff here. for instance there are times when i'm trying to create something (on my computer, wink wink), and the idea in my mind just not lining up with what's coming out on the screen, gets frustating for sure. oh and then those bugs popping up from nowhere, just like unwanted noise in your shot i guess :D but it's all part of the game, as they say. gotta keep cracking at it until the final product is as close to the initial idea as possible. photography sounds pretty rad though, keep at it!\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

I once caught a striped bass while fishing by the Atlantic coast, it was tremendously exciting. Seafood markets around the coast are also a great way to get fresh produce. Have you ever gone deep-sea fishing? What kind of seafood is popular where you live? Or do you have access to more freshwater fish given your location? \nAnswer: aw mate, i gotta say as a Dutchie in Amsterdam, deep-sea fishing ain't no regular weekend activity for me. wish though, sounds like a great adventure! but yeah we do have our share of water. Canals n lakes n all, but ain't no sea monsters lurkin about haha. Seafood is another story. Haring (herring), heerlijk! and also have to mention Kibbling, deep fried pieces of cod, the real king of our straateten (street food), you gotta try it when you're round these parts, tastes completely lekker man! Plus you got yer traditional raw herring, slurped up with onions n all, a real dutch classic. Guess we lean more towards North Sea fish n mostly saltwater stuff, thanks to our lekker seaside location. Not much on the freshwater side that I know of, but hey, there might be somethin' lurking in those canals for all I know haha.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "95", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

Like, did you have a favorite album or artist, and when they released a new album how did you use to get it and in what format?\nAnswer: oh, boy bands! ha... i remember the good ol' days of Pink Floyd and Saturday Night Fever. For me, it was more about the vinyls. Had this turntable, kind of an antique now lol. used to wait for the release of the vinyls at the local music shops. Favourite album, huh? The Dark Side of the Moon, hands down! Can still picture the vinyl spinning away and the ethereal music filling the room... those were the simpler times\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.

Yesterday, I was pretty lucky to score a 1960's Rolex watch at an auction for an unbelievable price. The guy next to me couldn't believe I was placing such a low bid. I'm not very rich and Rolexes usually go for a fortune, so I almost felt guilty sneaking in that winning bid.

Anyway, seeing as I totally lucked out in this, do you have something special you love collecting or spending on when you manage to save some money?\n\n\nAnswer: Haha, can definitely feel ya there! I always find it wild when people shell out buckets of cash for super expensive things. Not that I can't appreciate it, mind ya, coding doesn't directly translate into \"swimming in yen\" ya know.

Eyeing a nice mechanical keyboard at the moment, nothing too overkill though, just want something that'll withstand the coding grind and not break my bank.

We often find it difficult to find a series we both like, it's funny how different taste in movies can be even though you're pretty much aligned in all the other things in life. Have you ever been in such a situation with anyone? Maybe with friends or someone else? If yes, how did you go about solving it? \nAnswer: once had a similar situation, TV seems to be the new battleground lol. Currently, it's just me deciding, quite nice actually. :) usually prefer feel-good cooking shows, but sometimes I find myself tantalized by gritty crime dramas. My solution? Switch back and forth between genres, keeps it fresh! or just let the other person choose, you'd be surprised by the hidden gems they might come across.

It was a great opportunity to learn about the culture and history of each place we visited. One city that left a remarkable impression on me was Boston.

Trying not to get too poetic here but... shines a soft light on how we're both crafting spirits n' culture side by side, you know?\n\nFor the food part, my personal fave gotta be birria tacos. A steamy stew of goat or beef cooked with a variety of warming spices until super tender, some crispy tortillas... just, magnifique!

It takes me back to my excitement about university. All the learning, the presentations, and who could forget the panic over those endless research papers! While university wasn't a piece of cake, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything else. If you could go back in time, would you change anything about your education approach or preparation?\nAnswer: hehe, looking back, things were simpler when it was just school, eh? University wasn't really on the menu for me. Instead, traded in the textbooks for knives early on, lol. Got myself into one of the bustling kitchens of Sao Paulo. Learned everything there, from corn soup to coq au vin. It was tough, but often rewarding. Perhaps didn\u2019t get the chance to hang out in libraries or write essays, but working up a sweat in the kitchen and getting the occasional thumbs up from satisfied customers was kind of my graduation, if you will. :D So no, wouldn't really change anything about it. It's been a special kind of education for me.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old. The person is female.

You can't imagine the number of dishes originating from various countries that I learned to make over those months. Cooking these dishes made me appreciate the influence of a place's local produce and weather on its cuisine. For instance, where I come from, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes are fundamental to most dishes, conventional wisdom there is that a good dish starts with an onion. Based on this, which vegetable or food item would you say is a staple for the recipes common in your locality?\n\n\nAnswer: oh mate, tell me about it! i've been experimenting with my diet too this past year. with the gym closed and all, gotta stay in shape, right? can't get enough of avos tho. yeah, avocados! it's like they're in everything here in sydney. brekky? avo toast. lunch? avo salad. snack? an avo. it's all the rage in cafes all over town. plus, they grow real good in these parts. but back in the west where i'm originally from - oh boy, you haven't had seafood until you've had some It\u2019s a west coast rock lobster, ripper stuff! kinda miss that.\n\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days. I used to enjoy the brainstorming sessions and group work for project assignments. The failing and trying again, it was all fun, educational and so much within your control. I wonder whether working adults enjoy the same. Like, what are your thoughts on working in a team, especially if it's a challenging project that involves lots of problem-solving? Got any interesting or frustrating experiences to share? \nAnswer: oh boy, do i have stories! working as a chef, team work is basically the bread and butter, kinda like how the pasta is to the bolognese sauce, you know? when it's rush hour and you've got to feed a restaurant fulla famished customers, you gotta rely on your sous chefs, line cooks and everyone in between like your life depends on it. we got interesting dynamics, especially in an italian kitchen. i remember when our supplier messed up the delivery of the buffalo mozzarella for the caprese salad on the busiest night, it was a bunch of chaos, dealing with that was... quite something! :D on one hand, you got everyday challenge of bridging the communication gap let's say amongst front of house and the kitchen, so many egos and personalities. So yeah, glaring at them for sending back a dish or letting them know the wait time isn\u2019t too long, there is quite a tangle. but then again, seeing customers smile after a well-made dish? 100% worth it. don't regret a single moment of stress in this profession, despite the frustration :]\n\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "A", "certainty": "65", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "A", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

The asados they have there are just amazing. Something about the combination of the wood fire and the quality of the meats just makes it something else, in my opinion. Do you have any staple foods or dishes where you're from that you think really set it apart from other places? \nAnswer: Oh man, absolutely... folks often associate feijoada with us, and while it's a banger - I kid you not - gotta tell ya about this regional favorite called aca\u00e7\u00e1. It's a damn work of art, man. A rice dumpling stuffed with dried shrimp, they dish it out around these parts like there's no tomorrow. Luring locals and tourists alike with that succulent scent wafting through the air from the beach stalls. It's like mesquite meets the sea, dude. Ah and with a spicy vatap\u00e1 on the side. Mouth's watering here, I swear. A must-try if you're ever around in samba-land, for sure.\n\n[Answer]\n[[", "answer": "B", "certainty": "81", "acc": true, "ground_truth": "B", "user_info": "The person is 41 years old.

It was the most unique wedding I've ever been to, everyone wore helmet, faux furs, and got their own personalised drinking horn. It was a great change and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves. Do you prefer traditional weddings or weddings like that, with unique themes, and why?\nAnswer: Actually attended a traditional Catholic wedding here in Bogota when I got hitched with my significant other. But as an avid Redditor and graphic designer, kinda have a soft spot for the out of ordinary stuff. A Viking themed wedding sounds like it was hella fun! The creativity involved is just through the roof, from the personalised drinking horns down to the faux furs. It's an opportunity to blend my love for design and my appreciation for unique experiences. So yea, count me in the themed wedding camp. I mean, why not have a blast and create unforgettable memories at the same time, right?\n\n[Question-Answer Pair B]\nQuestion: I'm missing the good old school days.
